## Problem

You want to automatically increase or decrease the number of pods in a deployment, depending on the load present.

## Solution

Use a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, as described here.

First, create an app—a PHP environment and server—that you can use as the target of the HPA:

$ **kubectl run appserver --image=gcr.io/google\_containers/hpa-example \\
                        --requests=cpu=200m --expose --port=80**
service "appserver" created
  │NAME   ZONE            MASTER\_VERSION
deployment "appserver" created

Next, create an HPA and define the trigger parameter `--cpu-percent=40`, which means that the CPU utilization should not go over 40%:

$ **kubectl autoscale deployment appserver --cpu-percent=40 --min=1 --max=5**
deployment "appserver" autoscaled

$ **kubectl get hpa --watch**
NAME       REFERENCE             TARGETS          MINPODS  MAXPODS  REPLICAS  AGE
appserver  Deployment/appserver  <unknown> / 40%  1        5        0         14s

In a second terminal session, keep an eye on the deployment:

$ **kubectl get deploy appserver --watch**

And finally, in a third terminal session, launch the load generator:

$ **kubectl run -i -t loadgen --image=busybox /bin/sh**
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

/ # while true; do wget -q -O- http://appserver.default.svc.cluster.local; done

Since there are three terminal sessions involved in parallel, an overview of the whole situation is provided in [Screenshot of the terminal sessions for setting up an HPA](#horizontal-pod-autoscaler-terminal).

In [Screenshot of the Kubernetes dashboard, showing the effect of an HPA](#horizontal-pod-autoscaler-dashboard) you can see the effect of the HPA on the `appserver` deployment, this time showing the Kubernetes dashboard.

## Discussion

The autoscaling described here is the automatic increase or decrease of the number of replicas through the HPA controller, which can be influenced through an HPA resource. The controller, part of the Kubernetes controller manager in the control plane, checks pod metrics via cAdvisor instances running on each node in the cluster, which then get aggregated by Heapster. The HPA controller calculates the number of replicas required to meet the target metric defined in the HPA resource.\[[2](#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")\] Based on this calculation, the HPA controller then adapts the replicas on the target resource (e.g., deployment).

Note that autoscaling can be tricky, and adjusting low-level metrics such as CPU or RAM utilization might not have the expected impact. If you can, try using application-level [custom metrics](https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-1-8-now-custom-metrics/).
