## Problem

You want your GKE cluster to automatically grow or shrink in terms of the number of nodes, depending on the utilization.

## Solution

Use the GKE Cluster Autoscaler. This recipe assumes you’ve got the `gcloud` command installed and the environment set up (i.e., you’ve created a project and enabled billing).

First, create a cluster with one worker node and make sure you can access it with `kubectl`:

$ **gcloud container clusters create --num-nodes=1 supersizeme**
Creating cluster supersizeme...done.
Created \[https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/k8s-cookbook/zones/...\].
kubeconfig entry generated for supersizeme.
NAME         ZONE            MASTER\_VERSION  MASTER\_IP       ...  STATUS
supersizeme  europe-west2-b  1.7.8-gke.0     35.189.116.207  ...  RUNNING

$ **gcloud container clusters get-credentials supersizeme --zone europe-west2-b \\
                                                        --project k8s-cookbook**

Next, enable cluster autoscaling:

$ **gcloud beta container clusters update supersizeme --enable-autoscaling \\
                                                    --min-nodes=1 --max-nodes=3 \\
                                                    --zone=europe-west2-b \\
                                                    --node-pool=default-pool**

Note that if you haven’t enabled the `beta` command group you will be prompted in this step for permission to install it.

At this point in time, when looking at the Google Cloud console you should see something like what is shown in [Screenshot of the Google Cloud console, showing the initial cluster size of one node](#gke-cluster-autoscale-1-node).

Now, launch 15 pods using a deployment. This will generate enough load to trigger the cluster autoscaling:

$ **kubectl run ghost --image=ghost:0.9 --replicas=15**

You should now have a cluster of three nodes, as depicted in [Screenshot of the Google Cloud console, showing the resulting cluster scaled to three nodes](#gke-cluster-autoscale-3-nodes).

[Screenshot of the terminal sessions, showing the cluster autoscaling in action](#gke-cluster-autoscale-terminal) shows you see the entire interaction:

*   In the upper-left session you see the load (the 15 pods created, triggering the cluster scaling event).
    
*   In the upper-right session you see the `gcloud` command, enabling the cluster autoscaling.
    
*   In the bottom session you see the output of the `kubectl get nodes --watch` command, showing the current nodes available.

Note that all nodes in the node pool should have the same capacity, labels, and system pods running on them. Also, check that your quota is big enough when specifying the maximum settings for the node pool.

Don’t forget to do `gcloud container clusters delete supersizeme` when you’re done; otherwise, you’ll keep paying for the cluster resources.
