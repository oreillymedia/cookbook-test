## Problem

You have a deployment and want to scale it horizontally.

## Solution

Use the `kubectl scale` command to scale out a deployment.

Let’s reuse the `fancyapp` deployment from [\[deployments\]](#deployments), with five replicas. If it’s not running yet, create it with `kubectl create -f fancyapp.yaml`.

Now suppose that the load has decreased and you don’t need five replicas anymore; three is enough. To scale the deployment down to three replicas, do this:

$ **kubectl get deploy fancyapp**
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
fancyapp   5         5         5            5           9m

$ **kubectl scale deployment fancyapp --replicas=3**
deployment "fancyapp" scaled

$ **kubectl get deploy fancyapp**
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
fancyapp   3         3         3            3           10m

Rather than manually scaling a deployment, you can automate this process; see [Using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling on GKE](#auto_app_scaling_hpa_gke) for an example.
