__bash__ is a shell: a command interpreter. The main purpose of __bash__ (or of any shell) is to allow you to interact with the computer's operating system so that you can accomplish whatever you need to do. Usually that involves launching programs, so the shell takes the commands you type, determines from that input what programs need to be run, and launches them for you. You will also encounter tasks that involve a sequence of actions to perform that are recurring, or very complicated, or both. Shell programming, usually referred to as __shell scripting__, allows you to automate these tasks for ease of use, reliability, and reproducibility.

In case you're new to __bash__, we'll start with some basics. If you've used Unix or Linux at all, you probably aren't new to __bash__—but you may not have known you were using it. __bash__ is really just a language for executing commands—so the commands you've been typing all along (e.g., _ls_, _cd_, _grep_, _cat_) are, in a sense, __bash__ commands. Some of these commands are built into __bash__ itself; others are separate programs. For now, it doesn't make a difference which are which.

We'll end this chapter with a few recipes for getting __bash__. Most systems come with __bash__ preinstalled, but a few don't. Even if your system comes with __bash__, it's always a good idea to know how to get and install it—new versions, with new features, are released from time to time.
