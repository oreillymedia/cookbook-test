## Problem

You are not sure what directory you are in, and the default prompt is not helpful.

## Solution

Use the __pwd__ builtin command, or set a more useful prompt. For example:

`pwd`{{execute}}

`export PS1='[\u@\h \w]$ '`{{execute}}

## Discussion

__pwd__ stands for __print working directory__ and takes two options. ++-L++ displays your logical path and is the default. ++-P++ displays your physical location, which may differ from your logical path if you have followed a symbolic link. Similarly, the _cd_ command also provides ++-P++ and ++-L++ switches:

`pwd`{{execute}}

`pwd -L`{{execute}}

`pwd -P`{{execute}}
