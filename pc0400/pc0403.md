## Problem

You want to implement a custom iteration pattern that’s different than the usual built-in functions (e.g., `range()`, `reversed()`, etc.).

## Solution

If you want to implement a new kind of iteration pattern, define it using a generator function. Here’s a generator that produces a range of floating-point numbers:

```
def frange(start, stop, increment):
    x = start
    while x < stop:
        yield x
        x += increment
```{{execute}}

To use such a function, you iterate over it using a `for` loop or use it with some other function that consumes an iterable (e.g., `sum()`, `list()`, etc.). For example:

```
>>> for n in frange(0, 4, 0.5):
...     print(n)
...
0
0.5
1.0
1.5
2.0
2.5
3.0
3.5
>>> list(frange(0, 1, 0.125))
[0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875]
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The mere presence of the `yield` statement in a function turns it into a generator. Unlike a normal function, a generator only runs in response to iteration. Here’s an experiment you can try to see the underlying mechanics of how such a function works:

```
>>> def countdown(n):
...     print('Starting to count from', n)
...     while n > 0:
...             yield n
...             n -= 1
...     print('Done!')
...

>>> # Create the generator, notice no output appears
>>> c = countdown(3)
>>> c
<generator object countdown at 0x1006a0af0>

>>> # Run to first yield and emit a value
>>> next(c)
Starting to count from 3
3

>>> # Run to the next yield
>>> next(c)
2

>>> # Run to next yield
>>> next(c)
1

>>> # Run to next yield (iteration stops)
>>> next(c)
Done!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
>>>
```{{execute}}

The key feature is that a generator function only runs in response to "next" operations carried out in iteration. Once a generator function returns, iteration stops. However, the `for` statement that’s usually used to iterate takes care of these details, so you don’t normally need to worry about them.
