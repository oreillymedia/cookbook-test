## Problem

You have built a custom container object that internally holds a list, tuple, or some other iterable. You would like to make iteration work with your new container.

## Solution

Typically, all you need to do is define an `_iter_()` method that delegates iteration to the internally held container. For example:

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value
        self._children = []

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Node({!r})'.format(self._value)

    def add_child(self, node):
        self._children.append(node)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._children)

# Example
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(0)
    child1 = Node(1)
    child2 = Node(2)
    root.add_child(child1)
    root.add_child(child2)
    for ch in root:
        print(ch)
    # Outputs Node(1), Node(2)
```{{execute}}

In this code, the `_iter_()` method simply forwards the iteration request to the internally held `_children` attribute.

## Discussion

Python’s iterator protocol requires `_iter_()` to return a special iterator object that implements a `_next_()` method to carry out the actual iteration. If all you are doing is iterating over the contents of another container, you don’t really need to worry about the underlying details of how it works. All you need to do is to forward the iteration request along.

The use of the `iter()` function here is a bit of a shortcut that cleans up the code. `iter(s)` simply returns the underlying iterator by calling `s._iter_()`, much in the same way that `len(s)` invokes `s._len_()`.
