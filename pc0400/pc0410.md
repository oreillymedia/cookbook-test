## Problem

You want to iterate over a sequence, but would like to keep track of which element of the sequence is currently being processed.

## Solution

The built-in enumerate() function handles this quite nicely:

```
>>> my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> for idx, val in enumerate(my_list):
...     print(idx, val)
...
0 a
1 b
2 c
```{{execute}}

For printing output with canonical line numbers (where you typically start the numbering at 1 instead of 0), you can pass in a start argument:

```
>>> my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> for idx, val in enumerate(my_list, 1):
...     print(idx, val)
...
1 a
2 b
3 c
```{{execute}}

This case is especially useful for tracking line numbers in files should you want to use a line number in an error message:

```
def parse_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rt') as f:
         for lineno, line in enumerate(f, 1):
             fields = line.split()
             try:
                 count = int(fields[1])
                 ...
             except ValueError as e:
                 print('Line {}: Parse error: {}'.format(lineno, e))
```{{execute}}

enumerate() can be handy for keeping track of the offset into a list for occurrences of certain values, for example. So, if you want to map words in a file to the lines in which they occur, it can easily be accomplished using enumerate() to map each word to the line offset in the file where it was found:

```
word_summary = defaultdict(list)

with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

for idx, line in enumerate(lines):
    # Create a list of words in current line
    words = [w.strip().lower() for w in line.split()]
    for word in words:
        word_summary[word].append(idx)
```{{execute}}

If you print word\_summary after processing the file, it’ll be a dictionary (a defaultdict to be precise), and it’ll have a key for each word. The value for each word-key will be a list of line numbers that word occurred on. If the word occurred twice on a single line, that line number will be listed twice, making it possible to identify various simple metrics about the text.

## Discussion

`enumerate()` is a nice shortcut for situations where you might be inclined to keep your own counter variable. You could write code like this:

```
lineno = 1
for line in f:
    # Process line
    ...
    lineno += 1
```{{execute}}

But it’s usually much more elegant (and less error prone) to use `enumerate()` instead:

```
for lineno, line in enumerate(f):
    # Process line
    ...
```{{execute}}

The value returned by `enumerate()` is an instance of an `enumerate` object, which is an iterator that returns successive tuples consisting of a counter and the value returned by calling next() on the sequence you’ve passed in.

Although a minor point, it’s worth mentioning that sometimes it is easy to get tripped up when applying `enumerate()` to a sequence of tuples that are also being unpacked. To do it, you have to write code like this:

```
data = [ (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8) ]

# Correct!
for n, (x, y) in enumerate(data):
    ...

# Error!
for n, x, y in enumerate(data):
    ...
```{{execute}}
