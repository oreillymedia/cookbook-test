## Problem

You are building custom objects on which you would like to support iteration, but would like an easy way to implement the iterator protocol.

## Solution

By far, the easiest way to implement iteration on an object is to use a generator function. In [Delegating Iteration](#delegate_iteration), a `Node` class was presented for representing tree structures. Perhaps you want to implement an iterator that traverses nodes in a depth-first pattern. Here is how you could do it:

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value
        self._children = []

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Node({!r})'.format(self._value)

    def add_child(self, node):
        self._children.append(node)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._children)

    def depth_first(self):
        yield self
        for c in self:
            yield from c.depth_first()

# Example
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(0)
    child1 = Node(1)
    child2 = Node(2)
    root.add_child(child1)
    root.add_child(child2)
    child1.add_child(Node(3))
    child1.add_child(Node(4))
    child2.add_child(Node(5))

    for ch in root.depth_first():
        print(ch)
    # Outputs Node(0), Node(1), Node(3), Node(4), Node(2), Node(5)
```{{execute}}

In this code, the `depth_first()` method is simple to read and describe. It first yields itself and then iterates over each child yielding the items produced by the child’s `depth_first()` method (using `yield from`).

## Discussion

Python’s iterator protocol requires `_iter_()` to return a special iterator object that implements a `_next_()` operation and uses a `StopIteration` exception to signal completion. However, implementing such objects can often be a messy affair. For example, the following code shows an alternative implementation of the `depth_first()` method using an associated iterator class:

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value
        self._children = []

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Node({!r})'.format(self._value)

    def add_child(self, other_node):
        self._children.append(other_node)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._children)

    def depth_first(self):
        return DepthFirstIterator(self)

class DepthFirstIterator(object):
    '''
    Depth-first traversal
    '''
    def __init__(self, start_node):
        self._node = start_node
        self._children_iter = None
        self._child_iter = None

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        # Return myself if just started; create an iterator for children
        if self._children_iter is None:
            self._children_iter = iter(self._node)
            return self._node

        # If processing a child, return its next item
        elif self._child_iter:
            try:
                nextchild = next(self._child_iter)
                return nextchild
            except StopIteration:
                self._child_iter = None
                return next(self)

        # Advance to the next child and start its iteration
        else:
            self._child_iter = next(self._children_iter).depth_first()
            return next(self)
```{{execute}}

The `DepthFirstIterator` class works in the same way as the generator version, but it’s a mess because the iterator has to maintain a lot of complex state about where it is in the iteration process. Frankly, nobody likes to write mind-bending code like that. Define your iterator as a generator and be done with it.
