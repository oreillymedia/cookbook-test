## Problem

You want to iterate over all of the possible combinations or permutations of a collection of items.

## Solution

The `itertools` module provides three functions for this task. The first of these--`itertools.permutations()`â€”takes a collection of items and produces a sequence of tuples that rearranges all of the items into all possible permutations (i.e., it shuffles them into all possible configurations). For example:

```
>>> items = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> from itertools import permutations
>>> for p in permutations(items):
...     print(p)
...
('a', 'b', 'c')
('a', 'c', 'b')
('b', 'a', 'c')
('b', 'c', 'a')
('c', 'a', 'b')
('c', 'b', 'a')
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want all permutations of a smaller length, you can give an optional length argument. For example:

```
>>> for p in permutations(items, 2):
...     print(p)
...
('a', 'b')
('a', 'c')
('b', 'a')
('b', 'c')
('c', 'a')
('c', 'b')
>>>
```{{execute}}

Use `itertools.combinations()` to produce a sequence of combinations of items taken from the input. For example:

```
>>> from itertools import combinations
>>> for c in combinations(items, 3):
...     print(c)
...
('a', 'b', 'c')
>>> for c in combinations(items, 2):
...     print(c)
...
('a', 'b')
('a', 'c')
('b', 'c')
>>> for c in combinations(items, 1):
...     print(c)
...
('a',)
('b',)
('c',)
>>>
```{{execute}}

For `combinations()`, the actual order of the elements is not considered. That is, the combination `('a', 'b')` is considered to be the same as `('b', 'a')` (which is not produced).

When producing combinations, chosen items are removed from the collection of possible candidates (i.e., if `'a'` has already been chosen, then it is removed from consideration). The `itertools.combinations_with_replacement()` function relaxes this, and allows the same item to be chosen more than once. For example:

```
>>> for c in combinations_with_replacement(items, 3):
...     print(c)
...
('a', 'a', 'a')
('a', 'a', 'b')
('a', 'a', 'c')
('a', 'b', 'b')
('a', 'b', 'c')
('a', 'c', 'c')
('b', 'b', 'b')
('b', 'b', 'c')
('b', 'c', 'c')
('c', 'c', 'c')
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

This recipe demonstrates only some of the power found in the `itertools` module. Although you could certainly write code to produce permutations and combinations yourself, doing so would probably require more than a fair bit of thought. When faced with seemingly complicated iteration problems, it always pays to look at `itertools` first. If the problem is common, chances are a solution is already available.
