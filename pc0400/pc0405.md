## Problem

You want to iterate in reverse over a sequence.

## Solution

Use the built-in `reversed()` function. For example:

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> for x in reversed(a):
...     print(x)
...
4
3
2
1
```{{execute}}

Reversed iteration only works if the object in question has a size that can be determined or if the object implements a `_reversed_()` special method. If neither of these can be satisfied, you’ll have to convert the object into a list first. For example:

```
# Print a file backwards
f = open('somefile')
for line in reversed(list(f)):
    print(line, end='')
```{{execute}}

Be aware that turning an iterable into a list as shown could consume a lot of memory if it’s large.

## Discussion

Many programmers don’t realize that reversed iteration can be customized on user-defined classes if they implement the `_reversed_()` method. For example:

```
class Countdown(object):
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start

    # Forward iterator
    def __iter__(self):
        n = self.start
        while n > 0:
            yield n
            n -= 1

    # Reverse iterator
    def __reversed__(self):
        n = 1
        while n <= self.start:
            yield n
            n += 1
```{{execute}}

Defining a reversed iterator makes the code much more efficient, as it’s no longer necessary to pull the data into a list and iterate in reverse on the list.
