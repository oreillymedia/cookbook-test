## Problem

You need to process items in an iterable, but for whatever reason, you can’t or don’t want to use a `for` loop.

## Solution

To manually consume an iterable, use the `next()` function and write your code to catch the `StopIteration` exception. For example, this example manually reads lines from a file:

```
with open('/etc/passwd') as f:
    try:
        while True:
            line = next(f)
            print(line, end='')
    except StopIteration:
        pass
```{{execute}}

Normally, `StopIteration` is used to signal the end of iteration. However, if you’re using `next()` manually (as shown), you can also instruct it to return a terminating value, such as `None`, instead. For example:

```
with open('/etc/passwd') as f:
     while True:
         line = next(f, None)
         if line is None:
             break
         print(line, end='')
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

In most cases, the `for` statement is used to consume an iterable. However, every now and then, a problem calls for more precise control over the underlying iteration mechanism. Thus, it is useful to know what actually happens.

The following interactive example illustrates the basic mechanics of what happens during iteration:

```
>>> items = [1, 2, 3]
>>> # Get the iterator
>>> it = iter(items)     # Invokes items.__iter__()
>>> # Run the iterator
>>> next(it)             # Invokes it.__next__()
1
>>> next(it)
2
>>> next(it)
3
>>> next(it)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
>>>
```{{execute}}

Subsequent recipes in this chapter expand on iteration techniques, and knowledge of the basic iterator protocol is assumed. Be sure to tuck this first recipe away in your memory.
