## Problem

You need to perform the same operation on many objects, but the objects are contained in different containers, and you’d like to avoid nested loops without losing the readability of your code.

## Solution

The itertools.chain() method can be used to simplify this task. It takes a list of iterables as input, and returns an iterator that effectively masks the fact that you’re really acting on multiple containers. To illustrate, consider this example:

```
>>> from itertools import chain
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = ['x', 'y', 'z']
>>> for x in chain(a, b):
...     print(x)
...
1
2
3
4
x
y
z
>>>
```{{execute}}

A common use of chain() is in programs where you would like to perform certain operations on all of the items at once but the items are pooled into different working sets. For example:

```
# Various working sets of items
active_items = set()
inactive_items = set()

# Iterate over all items
for item in chain(active_items, inactive_items):
    # Process item
    ...
```{{execute}}

This solution is much more elegant than using two separate loops, as in the following:

```
for item in active_items:
    # Process item
    ...

for item in inactive_items:
    # Process item
    ...
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

itertools.chain() accepts one or more iterables as arguments. It then works by creating an iterator that successively consumes and returns the items produced by each of the supplied iterables you provided. It’s a subtle distinction, but chain() is more efficient than first combining the sequences and iterating. For example:

```
# Inefficent
for x in a + b:
    ...

# Better
for x in chain(a, b):
    ...
```{{execute}}

In the first case, the operation `a + b` creates an entirely new sequence and additionally requires `a` and `b` to be of the same type. `chain()` performs no such operation, so it’s far more efficient with memory if the input sequences are large and it can be easily applied when the iterables in question are of different types.
