## Problem

You have an internal service that is causing you trouble and you want to test that it is working well locally without exposing the service externally.

## Solution

Use a local proxy to the Kubernetes API server with `kubectl proxy`.

Letâ€™s assume that you have created a deployment and a service as described in [Removing a Pod from a Service](#relabel). You should see an `nginx` service when you list the services:

$ **kubectl get svc**
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
nginx        ClusterIP   10.109.24.56   <none>        80/TCP    22h

This service is not reachable outside the Kubernetes cluster. However, you can run a proxy in a separate terminal and then reach it on `localhost`.

Start by running the proxy in a separate terminal:

$ **kubectl proxy**
Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001

Tip

You can specify the port that you want the proxy to run on with the `--port` option.

In your original terminal, you can then use your browser or `curl` to access the application exposed by your service. Note the specific path to the service; it contains a `/proxy` part. Without this, you get the JSON object representing the service:

$ **curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/services/nginx/**
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...

Note

Note that you can now also access the entire Kubernetes API over `localhost` using `curl`.
