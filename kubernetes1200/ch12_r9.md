## Problem

You need to access `etcd` to back it up or verify the cluster state directly.

## Solution

Get access to `etcd` and query it, either using `curl` or [`etcdctl`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/etcdctl). For example, in the context of Minikube (with `jq` installed):

$ **minikube ssh**

$ **curl 127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/registry | jq .**
{
  "action": "get",
  "node": {
    "key": "/registry",
    "dir": true,
    "nodes": \[
      {
        "key": "/registry/persistentvolumeclaims",
        "dir": true,
        "modifiedIndex": 241330,
        "createdIndex": 241330
      },
      {
        "key": "/registry/apiextensions.k8s.io",
        "dir": true,
        "modifiedIndex": 641,
        "createdIndex": 641
      },
...

This technique can be used in environments where `etcd` is used with the [v2 API](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/README.html).

## Discussion

In Kubernetes, `etcd` is a component of the control plane. The API server (see [\[api\_endpoints\]](#api_endpoints)) is stateless and the only Kubernetes component that directly communicates with `etcd`, the distributed storage component that manages the cluster state. Essentially, `etcd` is a key/value store; in `etcd2` the keys formed a hierarchy, but with the introduction of [`etcd3`](https://coreos.com/blog/etcd3-a-new-etcd.html) this was replaced with a flat model (while maintaining backwards compatibility concerning hierarchical keys).

Note

Up until Kubernetes 1.5.2 we used `etcd2`, and from then on we switched to `etcd3`. In Kubernetes 1.5.x, `etcd3` is still used in v2 API mode and going forward this is changing to the `etcd` v3 API with v2 being deprecated soon. Though from a developer’s point of view this doesn’t have any implications, because the API server takes care of abstracting the interactions away, as an admin you want to pay attention to which etcd version is used in which API mode.

In general, it’s the responsibility of the cluster admin to manage `etcd`—that is, to upgrade it and make sure the data is backed up. In certain environments where the control plane is managed for you, such as in Google Kubernetes Engine, you cannot access `etcd` directly. This is by design, and there’s no workaround for it.
