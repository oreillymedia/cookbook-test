In this chapter, you will find recipes that deal with both app-level and cluster-level maintenance. We cover various aspects of troubleshooting, from debugging pods and containers, to testing service connectivity, interpreting a resourceâ€™s status, and node maintenance. Last but not least, we look at how to deal with etcd, the Kubernetes control plane storage component. This chapter is relevant for both cluster admins and app developers.
