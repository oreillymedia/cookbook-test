## Problem

You want to automatically record the order in which attributes and methods are defined inside a class body so that you can use it in various operations (e.g., serializing, mapping to databases, etc.).

## Solution

Capturing information about the body of class definition is easily accomplished through the use of a metaclass. Here is an example of a metaclass that uses an `OrderedDict` to capture definition order of descriptors:

```
from collections import OrderedDict

# A set of descriptors for various types
class Typed(object):
    _expected_type = type(None)
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        self._name = name

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if not isinstance(value, self._expected_type):
            raise TypeError('Expected ' + str(self._expected_type))
        instance.__dict__[self._name] = value

class Integer(Typed):
    _expected_type = int

class Float(Typed):
    _expected_type = float

class String(Typed):
    _expected_type = str

# Metaclass that uses an OrderedDict for class body
class OrderedMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, clsdict):
        d = dict(clsdict)
        order = []
        for name, value in clsdict.items():
            if isinstance(value, Typed):
                value._name = name
                order.append(name)
        d['_order'] = order
        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, d)

    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(cls, clsname, bases):
        return OrderedDict()
```{{execute}}

In this metaclass, the definition order of descriptors is captured by using an `OrderedDict` during the execution of the class body. The resulting order of names is then extracted from the dictionary and stored into a class attribute `_order`. This can then be used by methods of the class in various ways. For example, here is a simple class that uses the ordering to implement a method for serializing the instance data as a line of CSV data:

```
class Structure(metaclass=OrderedMeta):
    def as_csv(self):
        return ','.join(str(getattr(self,name)) for name in self._order)

# Example use
class Stock(Structure):
    name = String()
    shares = Integer()
    price = Float()
    def __init__(self, name, shares, price):
        self.name = name
        self.shares = shares
        self.price = price
```{{execute}}

Here is an interactive session illustrating the use of the `Stock` class in the example:

```
>>> s = Stock('GOOG',100,490.1)
>>> s.name
'GOOG'
>>> s.as_csv()
'GOOG,100,490.1'
>>> t = Stock('AAPL','a lot', 610.23)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "dupmethod.py", line 34, in __init__
TypeError: shares expects <class 'int'>
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The entire key to this recipe is the `_prepare_()` method, which is defined in the `OrderedMeta` metaclass. This method is invoked immediately at the start of a class definition with the class name and base classes. It must then return a mapping object to use when processing the class body. By returning an `OrderedDict` instead of a normal dictionary, the resulting definition order is easily captured.

It is possible to extend this functionality even further if you are willing to make your own dictionary-like objects. For example, consider this variant of the solution that rejects duplicate definitions:

```
from collections import OrderedDict

class NoDupOrderedDict(OrderedDict):
    def __init__(self, clsname):
        self.clsname = clsname
        super().__init__()
    def __setitem__(self, name, value):
        if name in self:
            raise TypeError('{} already defined in {}'.format(name, self.clsname))
        super().__setitem__(name, value)

class OrderedMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, clsdict):
        d = dict(clsdict)
        d['_order'] = [name for name in clsdict if name[0] != '_']
        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, d)

    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(cls, clsname, bases):
        return NoDupOrderedDict(clsname)
```{{execute}}

Hereâ€™s what happens if you use this metaclass and make a class with duplicate entries:

```
>>> class A(metaclass=OrderedMeta):
...     def spam(self):
...             pass
...     def spam(self):
...             pass
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in A
  File "dupmethod2.py", line 25, in __setitem__
    (name, self.clsname))
TypeError: spam already defined in A
>>>
```{{execute}}

A final important part of this recipe concerns the treatment of the modified dictionary in the metaclass `_new_()` method. Even though the class was defined using an alternative dictionary, you still have to convert this dictionary to a proper `dict` instance when making the final class object. This is the purpose of the `d = dict(clsdict)` statement.

Being able to capture definition order is a subtle but important feature for certain kinds of applications. For instance, in an object relational mapper, classes might be written in a manner similar to that shown in the example:

```
class Stock(Model):
    name = String()
    shares = Integer()
    price = Float()
```{{execute}}

Underneath the covers, the code might want to capture the definition order to map objects to tuples or rows in a database table (e.g., similar to the functionality of the `as_csv()` method in the example). The solution shown is very straightforward and often simpler than alternative approaches (which typically involve maintaining hidden counters within the descriptor classes).
