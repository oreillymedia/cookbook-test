## Problem

You have a sequence of items, and you’d like to determine the most frequently occurring items in the sequence.

## Solution

The `collections.Counter` class is designed for just such a problem. It even comes with a handy `most_common()` method that will give you the answer.

To illustrate, let’s say you have a list of words and you want to find out which words occur most often. Here’s how you would do it:

```
words = [
   'look', 'into', 'my', 'eyes', 'look', 'into', 'my', 'eyes',
   'the', 'eyes', 'the', 'eyes', 'the', 'eyes', 'not', 'around', 'the',
   'eyes', "don't", 'look', 'around', 'the', 'eyes', 'look', 'into',
   'my', 'eyes', "you're", 'under'
]

from collections import Counter
word_counts = Counter(words)
top_three = word_counts.most_common(3)
print(top_three)
# Outputs [('eyes', 8), ('the', 5), ('look', 4)]
# press 'return' in terminal to complete this block

```{{execute}}

## Discussion

As input, `Counter` objects can be fed any sequence of hashable input items. Under the covers, a `Counter` is a dictionary that maps the items to the number of occurrences. For example:

`word_counts['not']  # 1`{{execute}}

`word_counts['eyes']  # 8{{execute}}


If you want to increment the count manually, simply use addition:

```
morewords = ['why','are','you','not','looking','in','my','eyes']
for word in morewords:
    word_counts[word] += 1

word_counts['eyes']  # 9

```{{execute}}

Or, alternatively, you could use the `update()` method:

`word_counts.update(morewords)`{{execute}}

A little-known feature of `Counter` instances is that they can be easily combined using various mathematical operations. For example:

```
a = Counter(words)
b = Counter(morewords)

a
b
```{{execute}}

```
# Combine counts
c = a + b

c
```{{execute}}

```
# Subtract counts
d = a - b

d
```{{execute}}

Needless to say, `Counter` objects are a tremendously useful tool for almost any kind of problem where you need to tabulate and count data. You should prefer this over manually written solutions involving dictionaries.
