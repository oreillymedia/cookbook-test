## Problem

You have code that accesses list or tuple elements by position, but this makes the code somewhat difficult to read at times. You’d also like to be less dependent on position in the structure, by accessing the elements by name.

## Solution

`collections.namedtuple()` provides these benefits, while adding minimal overhead over using a normal tuple object. `collections.namedtuple()` is actually a factory method that returns a subclass of the standard Python tuple type. You feed it a type name, and the fields it should have, and it returns a class that you can instantiate, passing in values for the fields you’ve defined, and so on. For example:

```
from collections import namedtuple
Subscriber = namedtuple('Subscriber', ['addr', 'joined'])
sub = Subscriber('jonesy@example.com', '2012-10-19')
sub  # Subscriber(addr='jonesy@example.com', joined='2012-10-19')

sub.addr  # 'jonesy@example.com'

sub.joined  # '2012-10-19'
```{{execute}}

Although an instance of a namedtuple looks like a normal class instance, it is interchangeable with a tuple and supports all of the usual tuple operations such as indexing and unpacking. For example:

```
len(sub)  # 2

addr, joined = sub
addr  # 'jonesy@example.com'

joined  # '2012-10-19'

```{{execute}}

A major use case for named tuples is decoupling your code from the position of the elements it manipulates. So, if you get back a large list of tuples from a database call, then manipulate them by accessing the positional elements, your code could break if, say, you added a new column to your table. Not so if you first cast the returned tuples to namedtuples.

To illustrate, here is some code using ordinary tuples:

```
def compute_cost(records):
    total = 0.0
    for rec in records:
        total += rec[1] * rec[2]
    return total

# hit 'return' in terminal to complete this block

```{{execute}}

References to positional elements often make the code a bit less expressive and more dependent on the structure of the records. Here is a version that uses a namedtuple:

```
from collections import namedtuple

Stock = namedtuple('Stock', ['name', 'shares', 'price'])

def compute_cost(records):
    total = 0.0
    for rec in records:
        s = Stock(*rec)
        total += s.shares * s.price
    return total

# hit 'return' in terminal to complete this block

```{{execute}}

Naturally, you can avoid the explicit conversion to the `Stock` namedtuple if the `records` sequence in the example already contained such instances.

## Discussion

One possible use of a `namedtuple` is as a replacement for a dictionary, which requires more space to store. Thus, if you are building large data structures involving dictionaries, use of a `namedtuple` will be more efficient. However, be aware that unlike a dictionary, a `namedtuple` is immutable. For example:

```
s = Stock('ACME', 100, 123.45)
s  # Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45)

s.shares = 75

```{{execute}}

If you need to change any of the attributes, it can be done using the `_replace()` method of a `namedtuple` instance, which makes an entirely new `namedtuple` with specified values replaced. For example:

```
s = s._replace(shares=75)
s  # Stock(name='ACME', shares=75, price=123.45)

```{{execute}}

A subtle use of the `_replace()` method is that it can be a convenient way to populate named tuples that have optional or missing fields. To do this, you make a prototype tuple containing the default values and then use `_replace()` to create new instances with values replaced. For example:

```
from collections import namedtuple

Stock = namedtuple('Stock', ['name', 'shares', 'price', 'date', 'time'])

# Create a prototype instance
stock_prototype = Stock('', 0, 0.0, None, None)

# Function to convert a dictionary to a Stock
def dict_to_stock(s):
    return stock_prototype._replace(**s)

# hit 'return' in terminal to complete this block

```{{execute}}

Here is an example of how this code would work:

```
a = {'name': 'ACME', 'shares': 100, 'price': 123.45}
dict_to_stock(a)  # Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45, date=None, time=None)
a
```{{execute}}

```
b = {'name': 'ACME', 'shares': 100, 'price': 123.45, 'date': '12/17/2012'}
dict_to_stock(b)  # Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45, date='12/17/2012', time=None)
b

```{{execute}}

Last, but not least, it should be noted that if your goal is to define an efficient data structure where you will be changing various instance attributes, using `namedtuple` is not your best choice. Instead, consider defining a class using  `_slots_` instead.
