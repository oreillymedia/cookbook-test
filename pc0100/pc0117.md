## Problem

You want to make a dictionary that is a subset of another dictionary.

## Solution

This is easily accomplished using a dictionary comprehension. For example:

```
prices = {
   'ACME': 45.23,
   'AAPL': 612.78,
   'IBM': 205.55,
   'HPQ': 37.20,
   'FB': 10.75
}

# Make a dictionary of all prices greater than 200
p1 = { key:value for key, value in prices.items() if value > 200 }
p1
```{{executue}}

```
# Make a dictionary of tech stocks
tech_names = { 'AAPL', 'IBM', 'HPQ', 'MSFT' }
p2 = { key:value for key,value in prices.items() if key in tech_names }
p2
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Much of what can be accomplished with a dictionary comprehension might also be done by creating a sequence of tuples and passing them to the `dict()` function. For example:

```
p1 = dict((key, value) for key, value in prices.items() if value > 200)
p1

```{{execute}}

However, the dictionary comprehension solution is a bit clearer and actually runs quite a bit faster (over twice as fast when tested on the `prices` dictionary used in the example).

Sometimes there are multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. For instance, the second example could be rewritten as:

```
# Make a dictionary of tech stocks
tech_names = { 'AAPL', 'IBM', 'HPQ', 'MSFT' }
p2 = { key:prices[key] for key in prices.keys() & tech_names }
p2
```{{execute}}

However, a timing study reveals that this solution is almost 1.6 times slower than the first solution. If performance matters, it usually pays to spend a bit of time studying it.
