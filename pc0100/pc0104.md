## Problem

You want to make a list of the largest or smallest N items in a collection.

## Solution

The `heapq` module has two functions--`nlargest()` and `nsmallest()`—that do exactly what you want. For example:

```
import heapq

nums = [1, 8, 2, 23, 7, -4, 18, 23, 42, 37, 2]

print(heapq.nlargest(3, nums))
print(heapq.nsmallest(3, nums))
```{{execute}}

Both functions also accept a key parameter that allows them to be used with more complicated data structures. For example:

```
portfolio = [
   {'name': 'IBM', 'shares': 100, 'price': 91.1},
   {'name': 'AAPL', 'shares': 50, 'price': 543.22},
   {'name': 'FB', 'shares': 200, 'price': 21.09},
   {'name': 'HPQ', 'shares': 35, 'price': 31.75},
   {'name': 'YHOO', 'shares': 45, 'price': 16.35},
   {'name': 'ACME', 'shares': 75, 'price': 115.65}
]

cheap = heapq.nsmallest(3, portfolio, key=lambda s: s['price'])
expensive = heapq.nlargest(3, portfolio, key=lambda s: s['price'])
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

If you are looking for the N smallest or largest items and N is small compared to the overall size of the collection, these functions provide superior performance. Underneath the covers, they work by first converting the data into a list where items are ordered as a heap. For example:

```
nums = [1, 8, 2, 23, 7, -4, 18, 23, 42, 37, 2]

import heapq

heap = list(nums)
heapq.heapify(heap)
heap
```{{execute}}

The most important feature of a heap is that `heap[0]` is always the smallest item. Moreover, subsequent items can be easily found using the `heapq.heappop()` method, which pops off the first item and replaces it with the next smallest item (an operation that requires O(log N) operations where N is the size of the heap). For example, to find the three smallest items, you would do this:

`heapq.heappop(heap)`{{execute}}

`heapq.heappop(heap)`{{execute}}

`heapq.heappop(heap)`{{execute}}

The `nlargest()` and `nsmallest()` functions are most appropriate if you are trying to find a relatively small number of items. If you are simply trying to find the single smallest or largest item (N=1), it is faster to use `min()` and `max()`. Similarly, if N is about the same size as the collection itself, it is usually faster to sort it first and take a slice (i.e., use `sorted(items)[:N]` or `sorted(items)[-N:]`). It should be noted that the actual implementation of `nlargest()` and `nsmallest()` is adaptive in how it operates and will carry out some of these optimizations on your behalf (e.g., using sorting if N is close to the same size as the input).

Although it’s not necessary to use this recipe, the implementation of a heap is an interesting and worthwhile subject of study. This can usually be found in any decent book on algorithms and data structures. The documentation for the `heapq` module also discusses the underlying implementation details.
