## Problem

You want to keep a limited history of the last few items seen during iteration or during some other kind of processing.

## Solution

Keeping a limited history is a perfect use for a `collections.deque`. For example, the following code performs a simple text match on a sequence of lines and yields the matching line along with the previous N lines of context when found:

`from collections import deque`{{execute}}

```
def search(lines, pattern, history=5):
    previous_lines = deque(maxlen=history)
    for line in lines:
        if pattern in line:
            yield line, previous_lines
        previous_lines.append(line)

```{{execute}}

```
# Example use on a file
if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open('somefile.txt') as f:
        for line, prevlines in search(f, 'python', 5):
            for pline in prevlines:
                print(pline, end='')
            print(line, end='')
            print('-'*20)
```

## Discussion

When writing code to search for items, it is common to use a generator function involving `yield`, as shown in this recipe’s solution. This decouples the process of searching from the code that uses the results. 

Using `deque(maxlen=N)` creates a fixed-sized queue. When new items are added and the queue is full, the oldest item is automatically removed. For example:

`q = deque(maxlen=3)`{{execute}}

`q.append(1)`{{execute}}

`q.append(2)`{{execute}}

`q.append(3)`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}

`q.append(4)`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}

`q.append(5)`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}


Although you could manually perform such operations on a list (e.g., appending, deleting, etc.), the queue solution is far more elegant and runs a lot faster.

More generally, a `deque` can be used whenever you need a simple queue structure. If you don’t give it a maximum size, you get an unbounded queue that lets you append and pop items on either end. For example:

`q = deque()`{{execute}}

`q.append(1)`{{execute}}

`q.append(2)`{{execute}}

`q.append(3)`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}

`q.appendleft(4)`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}

`q.pop()`{{execute}}

`q`{{execute}}

`q.popleft()`{{execute}}


Adding or popping items from either end of a queue has O(1) complexity. This is unlike a list where inserting or removing items from the front of the list is O(N).
