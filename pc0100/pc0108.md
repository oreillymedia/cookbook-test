## Problem

You want to perform various calculations (e.g., minimum value, maximum value, sorting, etc.) on a dictionary of data.

## Solution

Consider a dictionary that maps stock names to prices:

```
prices = {
   'ACME': 45.23,
   'AAPL': 612.78,
   'IBM': 205.55,
   'HPQ': 37.20,
   'FB': 10.75
}
```{{execute}}

In order to perform useful calculations on the dictionary contents, it is often useful to invert the keys and values of the dictionary using `zip()`. For example, here is how to find the minimum and maximum price and stock name:

```
min_price = min(zip(prices.values(), prices.keys()))
# min_price is (10.75, 'FB')

max_price = max(zip(prices.values(), prices.keys()))
# max_price is (612.78, 'AAPL')
```{{execute}}

`min_price`{{execute}}

`max_price`{{execute}}

Similarly, to rank the data, use `zip()` with `sorted()`, as in the following:

```
prices_sorted = sorted(zip(prices.values(), prices.keys()))
# prices_sorted is [(10.75, 'FB'), (37.2, 'HPQ'),
#                   (45.23, 'ACME'), (205.55, 'IBM'),
#                   (612.78, 'AAPL')]
```{{execute}}

`priced_sorted`{{execute}}

When doing these calculations, be aware that `zip()` creates an iterator that can only be consumed once. For example, the following code is an error:

```
prices_and_names = zip(prices.values(), prices.keys())
print(min(prices_and_names))   # OK
print(max(prices_and_names))   # ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

If you try to perform common data reductions on a dictionary, you’ll find that they only process the keys, not the values. For example:

```
min(prices)   # Returns 'AAPL'
max(prices)   # Returns 'IBM'
```{{execute}}

This is probably not what you want because you’re actually trying to perform a calculation involving the dictionary values. You might try to fix this using the `values()` method of a dictionary:

```
min(prices.values())  # Returns 10.75
max(prices.values())  # Returns 612.78
```{{execute}}

Unfortunately, this is often not exactly what you want either. For example, you may want to know information about the corresponding keys (e.g., which stock has the lowest price?).

You can get the key corresponding to the min or max value if you supply a key function to `min()` and `max()`. For example:

```
min(prices, key=lambda k: prices[k])  # Returns 'FB'
max(prices, key=lambda k: prices[k])  # Returns 'AAPL'
```{{execute}}

However, to get the minimum value, you’ll need to perform an extra lookup step. For example:

```
min_value = prices[min(prices, key=lambda k: prices[k])]
```{{execute}}

The solution involving `zip()` solves the problem by "inverting" the dictionary into a sequence of `(value, key)` pairs. When performing comparisons on such tuples, the `value` element is compared first, followed by the `key`. This gives you exactly the behavior that you want and allows reductions and sorting to be easily performed on the dictionary contents using a single statement.

It should be noted that in calculations involving `(value, key)` pairs, the key will be used to determine the result in instances where multiple entries happen to have the same value. For instance, in calculations such as `min()` and `max()`, the entry with the smallest or largest key will be returned if there happen to be duplicate values. For example:

```
prices = { 'AAA' : 45.23, 'ZZZ': 45.23 }
min(zip(prices.values(), prices.keys()))  # Returns (45.23, 'AAA')

max(zip(prices.values(), prices.keys()))  # Returns (45.23, 'ZZZ')
```{{execute}}
