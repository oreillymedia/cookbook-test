## Problem

You want to sort objects of the same class, but they donâ€™t natively support comparison operations.

## Solution

The built-in sorted() function takes a key argument that can be passed a callable that will return some value in the object that sorted will use to compare the objects. For example, if you have a sequence of User instances in your application, and you want to sort them by their user_id attribute, you would supply a callable that takes a User instance as input and returns the user_id. For example:

```
class User(object):
... def __init__(self, user_id):
...     self.user_id = user_id
... def __repr__(self):
...     return 'User({})'.format(self.user_id)
...

users = [User(23), User(3), User(99)]

users  # [User(23), User(3), User(99)]

sorted(users, key=lambda u: u.user_id)  # [User(3), User(23), User(99)]

```{{execute}}

Instead of using `lambda`, an alternative approach is to use `operator.attrgetter()`:

```
from operator import attrgetter
sorted(users, key=attrgetter('user_id'))  # [User(3), User(23), User(99)]

```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The choice of whether or not to use `lambda` or `attrgetter()` may be one of personal preference. However, `attrgetter()` is often a tad bit faster and also has the added feature of allowing multiple fields to be extracted simultaneously. This is analogous to the use of `operator.itemgetter()` for dictionaries . For example, if `User` instances also had a `first_name` and `last_name` attribute, you could perform a sort like this:

```
by_name = sorted(users, key=attrgetter('last_name', 'first_name'))
```{{execute}}

It is also worth noting that the technique used in this recipe can be applied to functions such as `min()` and `max()`. For example:

```
min(users, key=attrgetter('user_id'))  # User(3)

max(users, key=attrgetter('user_id'))  # User(99)

```{{execute}}
