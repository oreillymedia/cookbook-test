## Problem

You have multiple dictionaries or mappings that you want to logically combine into a single mapping to perform certain operations, such as looking up values or checking for the existence of keys.

## Solution

Suppose you have two dictionaries:

`a = {'x': 1, 'z': 3 }`{{execute}}

`b = {'y': 2, 'z': 4 }`{{execute}}

Now suppose you want to perform lookups where you have to check both dictionaries (e.g., first checking in `a` and then in `b` if not found). An easy way to do this is to use the `ChainMap` class from the `collections` module. For example:

```
from collections import ChainMap
c = ChainMap(a,b)
print(c['x'])      # Outputs 1  (from a)
print(c['y'])      # Outputs 2  (from b)
print(c['z'])      # Outputs 3  (from a)
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

A `ChainMap` takes multiple mappings and makes them logically appear as one. However, the mappings are not literally merged together. Instead, a `ChainMap` simply keeps a list of the underlying mappings and redefines common dictionary operations to scan the list. Most operations will work. For example:

```
len(c)  # 3

list(c.keys())  # ['x', 'y', 'z']

list(c.values())  # [1, 2, 3]

```{{execute}}

If there are duplicate keys, the values from the first mapping get used. Thus, the entry `c['z']` in the example would always refer to the value in dictionary `a`, not the value in dictionary `b`.

Operations that mutate the mapping always affect the first mapping listed. For example:

```
c['z'] = 10
c['w'] = 40
del c['x']
a  # {'w': 40, 'z': 10}
del c['y']

```{{execute}}

A `ChainMap` is particularly useful when working with scoped values such as variables in a programming language (i.e., globals, locals, etc.). In fact, there are methods that make this easy:

```
values = ChainMap()
values['x'] = 1
# Add a new mapping
values = values.new_child()
values['x'] = 2
# Add a new mapping
values = values.new_child()
values['x'] = 3
values
ChainMap({'x': 3}, {'x': 2}, {'x': 1})
values['x']
# 3
# Discard last mapping
values = values.parents
values['x']  # 2

# Discard last mapping
values = values.parents
values['x']  # 1

values
ChainMap({'x': 1})

```{{execute}}

As an alternative to `ChainMap`, you might consider merging dictionaries together using the `update()` method. For example:

```
a = {'x': 1, 'z': 3 }
b = {'y': 2, 'z': 4 }
merged = dict(b)
merged.update(a)
merged['x']  # 1
```{{execute}}

`merged['y']  # 2`{{execute}}

`merged['z']  # 3`{{execute}}

This works, but it requires you to make a completely separate dictionary object (or destructively alter one of the existing dictionaries). Also, if any of the original dictionaries mutate, the changes don’t get reflected in the merged dictionary. For example:

`a['x'] = 13`{{execute}}

`merged['x']  # 1`{{execute}}

A `ChainMap` uses the original dictionaries, so it doesn’t have this behavior. For example:

`a = {'x': 1, 'z': 3 }`{{execute}}

`b = {'y': 2, 'z': 4 }`{{execute}}

`merged = ChainMap(a, b)`{{execute}}

`merged['x']  # 1`{{execute}}

`a['x'] = 42`{{execute}}

`merged['x']   # Notice change to merged dicts`{{execute}}
