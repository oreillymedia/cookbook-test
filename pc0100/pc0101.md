## Problem

You have an N-element tuple or sequence that you would like to unpack into a collection of N variables.

## Solution

Any sequence (or iterable) can be unpacked into variables using a simple assignment operation. The only requirement is that the number of variables and structure match the sequence. For example:

```
p = (4, 5)
x, y = p

```{{execute}}

```
x
y

```{{execute}}

```
data = [ 'ACME', 50, 91.1, (2012, 12, 21) ]
name, shares, price, date = data

```{{execute}}

```
name
date

```{{execute}}

`name, shares, price, (year, mon, day) = data`{{execute}}

```
name
year
mon
day

```{{execute}}

If there is a mismatch in the number of elements, you’ll get an error. For example:


`p = (4, 5)`{{execute}}

`x, y, z = p`{{execute}}

## Discussion

Unpacking actually works with any object that happens to be iterable, not just tuples or lists. This includes strings, files, iterators, and generators. For example:

```
s = 'Hello'
a, b, c, d, e = s

```{{execute}}

```
a
b
e

```{{execute}}

When unpacking, you may sometimes want to discard certain values. Python has no special syntax for this, but you can often just pick a throwaway variable name for it. For example:

```
data = [ 'ACME', 50, 91.1, (2012, 12, 21) ]
_, shares, price, _ = data

```{{execute}}

```
shares
price

```{{execute}}

However, make sure that the variable name you pick isn’t being used for something else already.
