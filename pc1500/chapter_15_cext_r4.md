This code contains a number of different C programming features. First, there are a few simple functions such as `gcd()` and `is_mandel()`. The `divide()` function is an example of a C function returning multiple values, one through a pointer argument. The `avg()` function performs a data reduction across a C array. The `Point` and `distance()` function involve C structures.
