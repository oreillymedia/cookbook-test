Although Python provides an extensive C programming API, there are actually many different approaches for dealing with C. Rather than trying to give an exhaustive reference for every possible tool or technique, the approach is to focus on a small fragment of C code along with some representative examples of how to work with the code. The goal is to provide a series of programming templates that experienced programmers can expand upon for their own use.
