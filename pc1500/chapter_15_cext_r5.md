For all of the recipes that follow, assume that the preceding code is found in a file named _sample.c_, that definitions are found in a file named _sample.h_ and that it has been compiled into a library `libsample` that can be linked to other C code. The exact details of compilation and linking vary from system to system, but that is not the primary focus. It is assumed that if you’re working with C code, you’ve already figured that out.
