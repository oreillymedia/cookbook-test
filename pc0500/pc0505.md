## Problem

You want to write data to a file, but only if it doesn’t already exist on the filesystem.

## Solution

This problem is easily solved by using the little-known `x` mode to `open()` instead of the usual `w` mode. For example:

```
>>> with open('somefile', 'wt') as f:
...     f.write('Hello\n')
...
>>> with open('somefile', 'xt') as f:
...     f.write('Hello\n')
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'somefile'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If the file is binary mode, use mode `xb` instead of `xt`.

## Discussion

This recipe illustrates an extremely elegant solution to a problem that sometimes arises when writing files (i.e., accidentally overwriting an existing file). An alternative solution is to first test for the file like this:

```
>>> import os
>>> if not os.path.exists('somefile'):
...     with open('somefile', 'wt') as f:
...         f.write('Hello\n')
... else:
...     print('File already exists!')
...
File already exists!
>>>
```{{execute}}

Clearly, using the `x` file mode is a lot more straightforward. It is important to note that the `x` mode is a Python 3 specific extension to the `open()` function. In particular, no such mode exists in earlier Python versions or the underlying C libraries used in Python’s implementation.
