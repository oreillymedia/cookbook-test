## Problem

You want to feed a text or binary string to code that’s been written to operate on file-like objects instead.

## Solution

Use the `io.StringIO()` and `io.BytesIO()` classes to create file-like objects that operate on string data. For example:

```
>>> s = io.StringIO()
>>> s.write('Hello World\n')
12
>>> print('This is a test', file=s)
15
>>> # Get all of the data written so far
>>> s.getvalue()
'Hello World\nThis is a test\n'
>>>

>>> # Wrap a file interface around an existing string
>>> s = io.StringIO('Hello\nWorld\n')
>>> s.read(4)
'Hell'
>>> s.read()
'o\nWorld\n'
>>>
```{{execute}}

The `io.StringIO` class should only be used for text. If you are operating with binary data, use the `io.BytesIO` class instead. For example:

```
>>> s = io.BytesIO()
>>> s.write(b'binary data')
>>> s.getvalue()
b'binary data'
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The `StringIO` and `BytesIO` classes are most useful in scenarios where you need to mimic a normal file for some reason. For example, in unit tests, you might use `StringIO` to create a file-like object containing test data that’s fed into a function that would otherwise work with a normal file.

Be aware that `StringIO` and `BytesIO` instances don’t have a proper integer file-descriptor. Thus, they do not work with code that requires the use of a real system-level file such as a file, pipe, or socket.
