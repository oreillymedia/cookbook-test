## Problem

You want to redirect the output of the `print()` function to a file.

## Solution

Use the `file` keyword argument to `print()`, like this:

```
with open('somefile.txt', 'wt') as f:
    print('hello world', file=f)
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Thereâ€™s not much more to printing to a file other than this. However, make sure that the file is opened in text mode. Printing will fail if the underlying file is in binary mode.
