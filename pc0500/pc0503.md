## Problem

You want to output data using `print()`, but you also want to change the separator character or line ending.

## Solution

Use the `sep` and `end` keyword arguments to `print()` to change the output as you wish. For example:

```
>>> print('ACME', 50, 91.5)
ACME 50 91.5
>>> print('ACME', 50, 91.5, sep=',')
ACME,50,91.5
>>> print('ACME', 50, 91.5, sep=',', end='!!\n')
ACME,50,91.5!!
>>>
```{{execute}}

Use of the `end` argument is also how you suppress the output of newlines in output. For example:

```
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i, end=' ')
...
0 1 2 3 4 >>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Using `print()` with a different item separator is often the easiest way to output data when you need something other than a space separating the items. Sometimes you’ll see programmers using `str.join()` to accomplish the same thing. For example:

```
>>> print(','.join('ACME','50','91.5'))
ACME,50,91.5
>>>
```{{execute}}

The problem with `str.join()` is that it only works with strings. This means that it’s often necessary to perform various acrobatics to get it to work. For example:

```
>>> row = ('ACME', 50, 91.5)
>>> print(','.join(row))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: sequence item 1: expected str instance, int found
>>> print(','.join(str(x) for x in row))
ACME,50,91.5
>>>
```{{execute}}

Instead of doing that, you could just write the following:

```
>>> print(*row, sep=',')
ACME,50,91.5
>>>
```{{execute}}
