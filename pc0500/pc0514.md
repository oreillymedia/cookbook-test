## Problem

You want to perform file I/O operations using raw filenames that have not been decoded or encoded according to the default filename encoding.

## Solution

By default, all filenames are encoded and decoded according to the text encoding returned by `sys.getfilesystemencoding()`. For example:

```
>>> sys.getfilesystemencoding()
'utf-8'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to bypass this encoding for some reason, specify a filename using a raw byte string instead. For example:

```
>>> # Wrte a file using a unicode filename
>>> with open('jalape\xf1o.txt', 'w') as f:
...     f.write('Spicy!')
...
6
>>> # Directory listing (decoded)
>>> import os
>>> os.listdir('.')
['jalapeño.txt']

>>> # Directory listing (raw)
>>> os.listdir(b'.')        # Note: byte string
[b'jalapen\xcc\x83o.txt']

>>> # Open file with raw filename
>>> with open(b'jalapen\xcc\x83o.txt') as f:
...     print(f.read())
...
Spicy!
>>>
```{{execute}}

As you can see in the last two operations, the filename handling changes ever so slightly when byte strings are supplied to file-related functions, such as `open()` and `os.listdir()`.

## Discussion

Under normal circumstances, you shouldn’t need to worry about filename encoding and decoding—​normal filename operations should just work. However, many operating systems may allow a user through accident or malice to create files with names that don’t conform to the expected encoding rules. Such filenames may mysteriously break Python programs that work with a lot of files.

Reading directories and working with filenames as raw undecoded bytes has the potential to avoid such problems, albeit at the cost of programming convenience.

See [Printing Bad Filenames](#bad_filenames) for a recipe on printing undecodable filenames.
