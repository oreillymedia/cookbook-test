## Problem

You want to write raw bytes to a file opened in text mode.

## Solution

Simply write the byte data to the files underlying `buffer`. For example:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.stdout.write(b'Hello\n')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: must be str, not bytes
>>> sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'Hello\n')
Hello
5
>>>
```{{execute}}

Similarly, binary data can be read from a text file by reading from its `buffer` attribute instead.

## Discussion

The I/O system is built from layers. Text files are constructed by adding a Unicode encoding/decoding layer on top of a buffered binary-mode file. The `buffer` attribute simply points at this underlying file. If you access it, youâ€™ll bypass the text encoding/decoding layer.

The example involving `sys.stdout` might be viewed as a special case. By default, `sys.stdout` is always opened in text mode. However, if you are writing a script that actually needs to dump binary data to standard output, you can use the technique shown to bypass the text encoding.
