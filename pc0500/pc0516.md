## Problem

You want to add or change the Unicode encoding of an already open file without closing it first.

## Solution

If you want to add Unicode encoding/decoding to an already existing file object that’s opened in binary mode, wrap it with an `io.TextIOWrapper()` object. For example:

```
import urllib.request
import io

u = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.python.org')
f = io.TextIOWrapper(u,encoding='utf-8')
text = f.read()
```{{execute}}

If you want to change the encoding of an already open text-mode file, use its `detach()` method to remove the existing text encoding layer before replacing it with a new one. Here is an example of changing the encoding on `sys.stdout`:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.stdout.encoding
'UTF-8'
>>> sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.detach(), encoding='latin-1')
>>> sys.stdout.encoding
'latin-1'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Doing this might break the output of your terminal. It’s only meant to illustrate.

## Discussion

The I/O system is built as a series of layers. You can see the layers yourself by trying this simple example involving a text file:

```
>>> f = open('sample.txt','w')
>>> f
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='sample.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
>>> f.buffer
<_io.BufferedWriter name='sample.txt'>
>>> f.buffer.raw
<_io.FileIO name='sample.txt' mode='wb'>
>>>
```{{execute}}

In this example, `io.TextIOWrapper` is a text-handling layer that encodes and decodes Unicode, `io.BufferedWriter` is a buffered I/O layer that handles binary data, and `io.FileIO` is a raw file representing the low-level file descriptor in the operating system. Adding or changing the text encoding involves adding or changing the topmost `io.TextIOWrapper` layer.

As a general rule, it’s not safe to directly manipulate the different layers by accessing the attributes shown. For example, see what happens if you try to change the encoding using this technique:

```
>>> f
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='sample.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
>>> f = io.TextIOWrapper(f.buffer, encoding='latin-1')
>>> f
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='sample.txt' encoding='latin-1'>
>>> f.write('Hello')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
>>>
```{{execute}}

It doesn’t work because the original value of `f` got destroyed and closed the underlying file in the process.

The `detach()` method disconnects the topmost layer of a file and returns the next lower layer. Afterward, the top layer will no longer be usable. For example:

```
>>> f = open('sample.txt', 'w')
>>> f
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='sample.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
>>> b = f.detach()
>>> b
<_io.BufferedWriter name='sample.txt'>
>>> f.write('hello')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached
>>>
```{{execute}}

Once detached, however, you can add a new top layer to the returned result. For example:

```
>>> f = io.TextIOWrapper(b, encoding='latin-1')
>>> f
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='sample.txt' encoding='latin-1'>
>>>
```{{execute}}

Although changing the encoding has been shown, it is also possible to use this technique to change the line handling, error policy, and other aspects of file handling. For example:

```
>>> sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.detach(), encoding='ascii',
...                               errors='xmlcharrefreplace')
>>> print('Jalape\u00f1o')
Jalape&#241;o
>>>
```{{execute}}

Notice how the non-ASCII character ñ has been replaced by `ñ` in the output.
