## Problem

You need to serialize a Python object into a byte stream so that you can do things such as save it to a file, store it in a database, or transmit it over a network connection.

## Solution

The most common approach for serializing data is to use the `pickle` module. To dump an object to a file, you do this:

```
import pickle

data = ...   # Some Python object
f = open('somefile', 'wb')
pickle.dump(data, f)
```{{execute}}

To dump an object to a string, use `pickle.dumps()`:

```
s = pickle.dumps(data)
```{{execute}}

To re-create an object from a byte stream, use either the `pickle.load()` or `pickle.loads()` functions. For example:

```
# Restore from a file
f = open('somefile', 'rb')
data = pickle.load(f)

# Restore from a string
data = pickle.loads(s)
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For most programs, usage of the `dump()` and `load()` function is all you need to effectively use pickle. It simply works with most Python data types and instances of user-defined classes. If you’re working with any kind of library that lets you do things such as save/restore Python objects in databases or transmit objects over the network, there’s a pretty good chance that `pickle` is being used.

`pickle` is a Python-specific self-describing data encoding. By self-describing, the serialized data contains information related to the start and end of each object as well as information about its type. Thus, you don’t need to worry about defining records—​it simply works. For example, if working with multiple objects, you can do this:

```
>>> import pickle
>>> f = open('somedata', 'wb')
>>> pickle.dump([1, 2, 3, 4], f)
>>> pickle.dump('hello', f)
>>> pickle.dump({'Apple', 'Pear', 'Banana'}, f)
>>> f.close()
>>> f = open('somedata', 'rb')
>>> pickle.load(f)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> pickle.load(f)
'hello'
>>> pickle.load(f)
{'Apple', 'Pear', 'Banana'}
>>>
```{{execute}}

You can pickle functions, classes, and instances, but the resulting data only encodes name references to the associated code objects. For example:

```
>>> import math
>>> import pickle
>>> pickle.dumps(math.cos)
b'\x80\x03cmath\ncos\nq\x00.'
>>>
```{{execute}}

When the data is unpickled, it is assumed that all of the required source is available. Modules, classes, and functions will automatically be imported as needed. For applications where Python data is being shared between interpreters on different machines, this is a potential maintenance issue, as all machines must have access to the same source code.

Warning

`pickle.load()` should never be used on untrusted data. As a side effect of loading, `pickle` will automatically load modules and make instances. However, an evildoer who knows how pickle works can create "malformed" data that causes Python to execute arbitrary system commands. Thus, it’s essential that pickle only be used internally with interpreters that have some ability to authenticate one another.

Certain kinds of objects can’t be pickled. These are typically objects that involve some sort of external system state, such as open files, open network connections, threads, processes, stack frames, and so forth. User-defined classes can sometimes work around these limitations by providing `_getstate_()` and `_setstate_()` methods. If defined, `pickle.dump()` will call `_getstate_()` to get an object that can be pickled. Similarly, `_setstate_()` will be invoked on unpickling. To illustrate what’s possible, here is a class that internally defines a thread but can still be pickled/unpickled:

```
# countdown.py
import time
import threading

class Countdown(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.thr = threading.Thread(target=self.run)
        self.thr.daemon = True
        self.thr.start()

    def run(self):
        while self.n > 0:
            print('T-minus', self.n)
            self.n -= 1
            time.sleep(5)

    def __getstate__(self):
        return self.n

    def __setstate__(self, n):
        self.__init__(n)
```{{execute}}

Try the following experiment involving pickling:

```
>>> import countdown
>>> c = countdown.Countdown(30)
>>> T-minus 30
T-minus 29
T-minus 28
...

>>> # After a few moments
>>> f = open('cstate.p', 'wb')
>>> import pickle
>>> pickle.dump(c, f)
>>> f.close()
```{{execute}}

Now quit Python and try this after restart:

```
>>> f = open('cstate.p', 'rb')
>>> pickle.load(f)
countdown.Countdown object at 0x10069e2d0>
T-minus 19
T-minus 18
...
```{{execute}}

You should see the thread magically spring to life again, picking up where it left off when you first pickled it.

`pickle` is not a particularly efficient encoding for large data structures such as binary arrays created by libraries like the `array` module or `numpy`. If you’re moving large amounts of array data around, you may be better off simply saving bulk array data in a file or using a more standardized encoding, such as HDF5 (supported by third-party libraries).

Because of its Python-specific nature and attachment to source code, you probably shouldn’t use `pickle` as a format for long-term storage. For example, if the source code changes, all of your stored data might break and become unreadable. Frankly, for storing data in databases and archival storage, you’re probably better off using a more standard data encoding, such as XML, CSV, or JSON. These encodings are more standardized, supported by many different languages, and more likely to be better adapted to changes in your source code.

Last, but not least, be aware that `pickle` has a huge variety of options and tricky corner cases. For the most common uses, you don’t need to worry about them, but a look at the [official documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) should be required if you’re going to build a signficant application that uses `pickle` for serialization.
