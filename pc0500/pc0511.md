## Problem

You need to manipulate pathnames in order to find the base filename, directory name, absolute path, and so on.

## Solution

To manipulate pathnames, use the functions in the `os.path` module. Here is an interactive example that illustrates a few key features:

```
>>> import os
>>> path = '/Users/beazley/Data/data.csv'

>>> # Get the last component of the path
>>> os.path.basename(path)
'data.csv'

>>> # Get the directory name
>>> os.path.dirname(path)
'/Users/beazley/Data'

>>> # Join path components together
>>> os.path.join('tmp', 'data', os.path.basename(path))
'tmp/data/data.csv'

>>> # Expand the user's home directory
>>> path = '~/Data/data.csv'
>>> os.path.expanduser(path)
'/Users/beazley/Data/data.csv'

>>> # Split the file extension
>>> os.path.splitext(path)
('~/Data/data', '.csv')
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For any manipulation of filenames, you should use the `os.path` module instead of trying to cook up your own code using the standard string operations. In part, this is for portability. The `os.path` module knows about differences between Unix and Windows and can reliably deal with filenames such as _Data/data.csv_ and _Data\\data.csv_. Second, you really shouldn’t spend your time reinventing the wheel. It’s usually best to use the functionality that’s already provided for you.

It should be noted that the `os.path` module has many more features not shown in this recipe. Consult the documentation for more functions related to file testing, symbolic links, and so forth.
