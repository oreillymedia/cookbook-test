## Problem

You want to get a list of the files contained in a directory on the filesystem.

## Solution

Use the `os.listdir()` function to obtain a list of files in a directory:

```
import os
names = os.listdir('somedir')
```{{execute}}

This will give you the raw directory listing, including all files, subdirectories, symbolic links, and so forth. If you need to filter the data in some way, consider using a list comprehension combined with various functions in the `os.path` library. For example:

```
import os.path
# Get all regular files
names = [name for name in os.listdir('somedir')
         if os.path.isfile(os.path.join('somedir', name))]

# Get all dirs
dirnames = [name for name in os.listdir('somedir')
            if os.path.isdir(os.path.join('somedir', name))]
```{{execute}}

The `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods of strings can be useful for filtering the contents of a directory as well. For example:

```
pyfiles = [name for name in os.listdir('somedir')
           if name.endswith('.py')]
```{{execute}}

For filename matching, you may want to use the `glob` or `fnmatch` modules instead. For example:

```
import glob
pyfiles = glob.glob('somedir/*.py')

from fnmatch import fnmatch
pyfiles = [name for name in os.listdir('somedir')
           if fnmatch(name, '*.py')]
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Getting a directory listing is easy, but it only gives you the names of entries in the directory. If you want to get additional metadata, such as file sizes, modification dates, and so forth, you either need to use additional functions in the `os.path` module or use the `os.stat()` function. To collect the data. For example:

```
# Example of getting a directory listing

import os
import os.path
import glob

pyfiles = glob.glob('*.py')

# Get file sizes and modification dates
name_sz_date = [(name, os.path.getsize(name), os.path.getmtime(name))
                for name in pyfiles]

for name, size, mtime in name_sz_date:
    print(name, size, mtime)

# Alternative: Get file metadata
file_metadata = [(name, os.stat(name)) for name in pyfiles]
for name, meta in file_metadata:
    print(name, meta.st_size, meta.st_mtime)
```{{execute}}

Last, but not least, be aware that there are subtle issues that can arise in filename handling related to encodings. Normally, the entries returned by a function such as `os.listdir()` are decoded according to the system default filename encoding. However, itâ€™s possible under certain circumstances to encounter un-decodable filenames. Recipes [#rawfilenames](#rawfilenames) and [#bad\_filenames](#bad_filenames) have more details about handling such names.
