## Problem

Your application receives temporal data in string format, but you want to convert those strings into datetime objects in order to perform nonstring operations on them.

## Solution

Python’s standard datetime module is typically the easy solution for this. For example:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> text = '2012-09-20'
>>> y = datetime.strptime(text, '%Y-%m-%d')
>>> z = datetime.now()
>>> diff = z - y
>>> diff
datetime.timedelta(3, 77824, 177393)
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The datetime.strptime() method supports a host of formatting codes, like %Y for the four-digit year and %m for the two-digit month. It’s also worth noting that these formatting placeholders also work in reverse, in case you need to represent a datetime object in string output and make it look nice.

For example, let’s say you have some code that generates a datetime object, but you need to format a nice, human-readable date to put in the header of an auto-generated letter or report:

```
>>> z
datetime.datetime(2012, 9, 23, 21, 37, 4, 177393)
>>> nice_z = datetime.strftime(z, '%A %B %d, %Y')
>>> nice_z
'Sunday September 23, 2012'
>>>
```{{execute}}

It’s worth noting that the performance of `strptime()` is often much worse than you might expect, due to the fact that it’s written in pure Python and it has to deal with all sorts of system locale settings. If you are parsing a lot of dates in your code and you know the precise format, you will probably get much better performance by cooking up a custom solution instead. For example, if you knew that the dates were of the form "YYYY-MM-DD," you could write a function like this:

```
from datetime import datetime
def parse_ymd(s):
    year_s, mon_s, day_s = s.split('-')
    return datetime(int(year_s), int(mon_s), int(day_s))
```{{execute}}

When tested, this function runs over seven times faster than `datetime.strptime()`. This is probably something to consider if you’re processing large amounts of data involving dates.
