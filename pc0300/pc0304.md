## Problem

You need to convert or output integers represented by binary, octal, or hexadecimal digits.

## Solution

To convert an integer into a binary, octal, or hexadecimal text string, use the `bin()`, `oct()`, or `hex()` functions, respectively:

```
>>> x = 1234
>>> bin(x)
'0b10011010010'
>>> oct(x)
'0o2322'
>>> hex(x)
'0x4d2'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Alternatively, you can use the `format()` function if you don’t want the `0b`, `0o`, or `0x` prefixes to appear. For example:

```
>>> format(x, 'b')
'10011010010'
>>> format(x, 'o')
'2322'
>>> format(x, 'x')
'4d2'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Integers are signed, so if you are working with negative numbers, the output will also include a sign. For example:

```
>>> x = -1234
>>> format(x, 'b')
'-10011010010'
>>> format(x, 'x')
'-4d2'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you need to produce an unsigned value instead, you’ll need to add in the maximum value to set the bit length. For example, to show a 32-bit value, use the following:

```
>>> x = -1234
>>> format(2**32 + x, 'b')
'11111111111111111111101100101110'
>>> format(2**32 + x, 'x')
'fffffb2e'
>>>
```{{execute}}

To convert integer strings in different bases, simply use the `int()` function with an appropriate base. For example:

```
>>> int('4d2', 16)
1234
>>> int('10011010010', 2)
1234
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For the most part, working with binary, octal, and hexadecimal integers is straightforward. Just remember that these conversions only pertain to the conversion of integers to and from a textual representation. Under the covers, there’s just one integer type.

Finally, there is one caution for programmers who use octal. The Python syntax for specifying octal values is slightly different than many other languages. For example, if you try something like this, you’ll get a syntax error:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.chmod('script.py', 0755)
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    os.chmod('script.py', 0755)
                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
>>>
```{{execute}}

Make sure you prefix the octal value with `0o`, as shown here:

```
>>> os.chmod('script.py', 0o755)
>>>
```{{execute}}
