## Problem

You need to create or test for the floating-point values of infinity, negative infinity, or NaN (not a number).

## Solution

Python has no special syntax to represent these special floating-point values, but they can be created using `float()`. For example:

```
>>> a = float('inf')
>>> b = float('-inf')
>>> c = float('nan')
>>> a
inf
>>> b
-inf
>>> c
nan
>>>
```{{execute}}

To test for the presence of these values, use the `math.isinf()` and `math.isnan()` functions. For example:

```
>>> math.isinf(a)
True
>>> math.isnan(c)
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For more detailed information about these special floating-point values, you should refer to the IEEE 754 specification. However, there are a few tricky details to be aware of, especially related to comparisons and operators.

Infinite values will propagate in calculations in a mathematical manner. For example:

```
>>> a = float('inf')
>>> a + 45
inf
>>> a * 10
inf
>>> 10 / a
0.0
>>>
```{{execute}}

However, certain operations are undefined and will result in a NaN result. For example:

```
>>> a = float('inf')
>>> a/a
nan
>>> b = float('-inf')
>>> a + b
nan
>>>
```{{execute}}

NaN values propagate through all operations without raising an exception. For example:

```
>>> c = float('nan')
>>> c + 23
nan
>>> c / 2
nan
>>> c * 2
nan
>>> math.sqrt(c)
nan
>>>
```{{execute}}

A subtle feature of NaN values is that they never compare as equal. For example:

```
>>> c = float('nan')
>>> d = float('nan')
>>> c == d
False
>>> c is d
False
>>>
```{{execute}}

Because of this, the only safe way to test for a NaN value is to use `math.isnan()`, as shown in this recipe.

Sometimes programmers want to change Python’s behavior to raise exceptions when operations result in an infinite or NaN result. The `fpectl` module can be used to adjust this behavior, but it is not enabled in a standard Python build, it’s platform-dependent, and really only intended for expert-level programmers. See [the online Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/library/fpectl.html) for further details.
