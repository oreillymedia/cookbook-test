## Problem

You want a general solution for finding a date for the last occurrence of a day of the week. Last Friday, for example.

## Solution

Python’s datetime module has utility functions and classes to help perform calculations like this. A decent, generic solution to this problem looks like this:

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday',
            'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

def get_previous_byday(dayname, start_date=None):
    if start_date is None:
        start_date = datetime.today()
    day_num = start_date.weekday()
    day_num_target = weekdays.index(dayname)
    days_ago = (7 + day_num - day_num_target) % 7
    if days_ago == 0:
        days_ago = 7
    target_date = start_date - timedelta(days=days_ago)
    return target_date
```{{execute}}

Using this in an interpreter session would look like this:

```
>>> datetime.today()  # For reference
datetime.datetime(2012, 8, 28, 22, 4, 30, 263076)
>>> get_previous_byday('Monday')
datetime.datetime(2012, 8, 27, 22, 3, 57, 29045)
>>> get_previous_byday('Tuesday') # Previous week, not today
datetime.datetime(2012, 8, 21, 22, 4, 12, 629771)
>>> get_previous_byday('Friday')
datetime.datetime(2012, 8, 24, 22, 5, 9, 911393)
>>>
```{{execute}}

The optional `start_date` can be supplied using another `datetime` instance. For example:

```
>>> get_previous_byday('Sunday', datetime(2012, 12, 21))
datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 16, 0, 0)
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

This recipe works by mapping the start date and the target date to their numeric position in the week (with `Monday` as day 0). Modular arithmetic is then used to figure out how many days ago the target date last occurred. From there, the desired date is calculated from the start date by subtracting an appropriate `timedelta` instance.

If you’re performing a lot of date calculations like this, you may be better off installing the [`python-dateutil` package](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil) instead. For example, here is an example of performing the same calculation using the `relativedelta()` function from `dateutil`:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
>>> from dateutil.rrule import *
>>> d = datetime.now()
>>> print(d)
2012-12-23 16:31:52.718111

>>> # Next Friday
>>> print(d + relativedelta(weekday=FR))
2012-12-28 16:31:52.718111
>>>

>>> # Last Friday
>>> print(d + relativedelta(weekday=FR(-1)))
2012-12-21 16:31:52.718111
>>>
```{{execute}}
