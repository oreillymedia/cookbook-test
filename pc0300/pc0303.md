## Problem

You need to format a number for output, controlling the number of digits, alignment, inclusion of a thousands separator, and other details.

## Solution

To format a single number for output, use the built-in `format()` function. For example:

```
>>> x = 1234.56789

>>> # Two decimal places of accuracy
>>> format(x, '0.2f')
'1234.57'

>>> # Right justified in 10 chars, one-digit accuracy
>>> format(x, '>10.1f')
'    1234.6'

>>> # Left justified
>>> format(x, '<10.1f')
'1234.6    '

>>> # Centered
>>> format(x, '^10.1f')
'  1234.6  '

>>> # Inclusion of thousands separator
>>> format(x, ',')
'1,234.56789'
>>> format(x, '0,.1f')
'1,234.6'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to use exponential notation, change the `f` to an `e` or `E`, depending on the case you want used for the exponential specifier. For example:

```
>>> format(x, 'e')
'1.234568e+03'
>>> format(x, '0.2E')
'1.23E+03'
>>>
```{{execute}}

The general form of the width and precision in both cases is `'[<>^]?width[,]?(.digits)?'` where `width` and `digits` are integers and `?` signifies optional parts. The same format codes are also used in the `.format()` method of strings. For example:

```
>>> 'The value is {:0,.2f}'.format(x)
'The value is 1,234.57'
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Formatting numbers for output is usually straightforward. The technique shown works for both floating-point numbers and `Decimal` numbers in the `decimal` module.

When the number of digits is restricted, values are rounded away according to the same rules of the `round()` function. For example:

```
>>> x
1234.56789
>>> format(x, '0.1f')
'1234.6'
>>> format(-x, '0.1f')
'-1234.6'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Formatting of values with a thousands separator is not locale aware. If you need to take that into account, you might investigate functions in the `locale` module. You can also swap separator characters using the `translate()` method of strings. For example:

```
>>> swap_separators = { ord('.'):',', ord(','):'.' }
>>> format(x, ',').translate(swap_separators)
'1.234,56789'
>>>
```{{execute}}

In a lot of Python code, numbers are formatted using the `%` operator. For example:

```
>>> '%0.2f' % x
'1234.57'
>>> '%10.1f' % x
'    1234.6'
>>> '%-10.1f' % x
'1234.6    '
>>>
```{{execute}}

This formatting is still acceptable, but less powerful than the more modern `format()` method. For example, some features (e.g., adding thousands separators) arenâ€™t supported when using the `%` operator to format numbers.
