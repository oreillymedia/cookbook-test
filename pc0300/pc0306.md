## Problem

Your code for interacting with the latest web authentication scheme has encountered a singularity and your only solution is to go around it in the complex plane. Or maybe you just need to perform some calculations using complex numbers.

## Solution

Complex numbers can be specified using the `complex(real, imag)` function or by floating-point numbers with a `j` suffix. For example:

```
>>> a = complex(2, 4)
>>> b = 3 - 5j
>>> a
(2+4j)
>>> b
(3-5j)
>>>
```{{execute}}

The real, imaginary, and conjugate values are easy to obtain, as shown here:

```
>>> a.real
2.0
>>> a.imag
4.0
>>> a.conjugate()
(2-4j)
>>>
```{{execute}}

In addition, all of the usual mathematical operators work:

```
>>> a + b
(5-1j)
>>> a * b
(26+2j)
>>> a / b
(-0.4117647058823529+0.6470588235294118j)
>>> abs(a)
4.47213595499958
>>>
```{{execute}}

To perform additional complex-valued functions such as sines, cosines, or square roots, use the `cmath` module:

```
>>> import cmath
>>> cmath.sin(a)
(24.83130584894638-11.356612711218174j)
>>> cmath.cos(a)
(-11.36423470640106-24.814651485634187j)
>>> cmath.exp(a)
(-4.829809383269385-5.5920560936409816j)
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Most of Python’s math-related modules are aware of complex values. For example, if you use `numpy`, it is straightforward to make arrays of complex values and perform operations on them:

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([2+3j, 4+5j, 6-7j, 8+9j])
>>> a
array([ 2.+3.j,  4.+5.j,  6.-7.j,  8.+9.j])
>>> a + 2
array([  4.+3.j,   6.+5.j,   8.-7.j,  10.+9.j])
>>> np.sin(a)
array([    9.15449915  -4.16890696j,   -56.16227422 -48.50245524j,
        -153.20827755-526.47684926j,  4008.42651446-589.49948373j])
>>>
```{{execute}}

Python’s standard mathematical functions do not produce complex values by default, so it is unlikely that such a value would accidentally show up in your code. For example:

```
>>> import math
>>> math.sqrt(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: math domain error
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want complex numbers to be produced as a result, you have to explicitly use `cmath` or declare the use of a complex type in libraries that know about them. For example:

```
>>> import cmath
>>> cmath.sqrt(-1)
1j
>>>
```{{execute}}
