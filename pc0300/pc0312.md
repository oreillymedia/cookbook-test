## Problem

You have code that needs to perform simple time conversions, like days to seconds, hours to minutes, and so on.

## Solution

To perform conversions and arithmetic involving different units of time, use the `datetime` module. For example, to represent an interval of time, create a `timedelta` instance, like this:

```
>>> from datetime import timedelta
>>> a = timedelta(days=2, hours=6)
>>> b = timedelta(hours=4.5)
>>> c = a + b
>>> c.days
2
>>> c.seconds
37800
>>> c.seconds / 3600
10.5
>>> c.total_seconds() / 3600
58.5
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you need to represent specific dates and times, create `datetime` instances and use the standard mathematical operations to manipulate them. For example:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> a = datetime(2012, 9, 23)
>>> print(a + timedelta(days=10))
2012-10-03 00:00:00
>>>
>>> b = datetime(2012, 12, 21)
>>> d = b - a
>>> d.days
89
>>> now = datetime.today()
>>> print(now)
2012-12-21 14:54:43.094063
>>> print(now + timedelta(minutes=10))
2012-12-21 15:04:43.094063
>>>
```{{execute}}

When making calculations, it should be noted that `datetime` is aware of leap years. For example:

```
>>> a = datetime(2012, 3, 1)
>>> b = datetime(2012, 2, 28)
>>> a - b
datetime.timedelta(2)
>>> (a - b).days
2
>>> c = datetime(2013, 3, 1)
>>> d = datetime(2013, 2, 28)
>>> (c - d).days
1
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For most basic date and time manipulation problems, the `datetime` module will suffice. If you need to perform more complex date manipulations, such as dealing with time zones, fuzzy time ranges, calculating the dates of holidays, and so forth, look at the [`dateutil` module](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil).

To illustrate, many similar time calculations can be performed with the `dateutil.relativedelta()` function. However, one notable feature is that it fills in some gaps pertaining to the handling of months (and their differing number of days). For instance:

```
>>> a = datetime(2012, 9, 23)
>>> a + timedelta(months=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'months' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
>>>

>>> from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
>>> a + relativedelta(months=+1)
datetime.datetime(2012, 10, 23, 0, 0)
>>> a + relativedelta(months=+4)
datetime.datetime(2013, 1, 23, 0, 0)
>>>

>>> # Time between two dates
>>> b = datetime(2012, 12, 21)
>>> d = b - a
>>> d
datetime.timedelta(89)
>>> d = relativedelta(b, a)
>>> d
relativedelta(months=+2, days=+28)
>>> d.months
2
>>> d.days
28
>>>
```{{execute}}
