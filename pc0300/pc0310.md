## Problem

You need to perform matrix and linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, finding determinants, solving linear equations, and so on.

## Solution

The [NumPy library](http://www.numpy.org) has a `matrix` object that can be used for this purpose. Matrices are somewhat similar to the array objects described in [Calculating with Large Numerical Arrays](#calculatingwithlargenumerical), but follow linear algebra rules for computation. Here is an example that illustrates a few essential features:

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> m = np.matrix([[1,-2,3],[0,4,5],[7,8,-9]])
>>> m
matrix([[ 1, -2,  3],
        [ 0,  4,  5],
        [ 7,  8, -9]])

>>> # Return transpose
>>> m.T
matrix([[ 1,  0,  7],
        [-2,  4,  8],
        [ 3,  5, -9]])

>>> # Return inverse
>>> m.I
matrix([[ 0.33043478, -0.02608696,  0.09565217],
        [-0.15217391,  0.13043478,  0.02173913],
        [ 0.12173913,  0.09565217, -0.0173913 ]])

>>> # Create a vector and multiply
>>> v = np.matrix([[2],[3],[4]])
>>> v
matrix([[2],
        [3],
        [4]])
>>> m * v
matrix([[ 8],
        [32],
        [ 2]])
>>>
```{{execute}}

More operations can be found in the `numpy.linalg` subpackage. For example:

```
>>> import numpy.linalg

>>> # Determinant
>>> numpy.linalg.det(m)
-229.99999999999983

>>> # Eigenvalues
>>> numpy.linalg.eigvals(m)
array([-13.11474312,   2.75956154,   6.35518158])

>>> # Solve for x in mx = v
>>> x = numpy.linalg.solve(m, v)
>>> x
matrix([[ 0.96521739],
        [ 0.17391304],
        [ 0.46086957]])
>>> m * x
matrix([[ 2.],
        [ 3.],
        [ 4.]])
>>> v
matrix([[2],
        [3],
        [4]])
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Linear algebra is obviously a huge topic thatâ€™s far beyond the scope of this cookbook. However, if you need to manipulate matrices and vectors, NumPy is a good starting point. Visit [http://www.numpy.org](http://www.numpy.org) for more detailed information.
