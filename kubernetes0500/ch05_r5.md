## Problem

You have created a service (see [Creating a Service to Expose Your Application](#simple_service)) and want to verify that your DNS registration is working properly.

## Solution

By default Kubernetes uses `ClusterIP` as the service type, and that exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. If the DNS cluster add-on is available and working properly, you can access the service via a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the form of `$SERVICENAME.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local`.

To verify that this is working as expected, get an interactive shell within a container in your cluster. The easiest way to do this is to use `kubectl run` with the `busybox` image, like so:

$ **kubectl run busybox --image busybox -it -- /bin/sh**
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

/ # nslookup nginx
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address 1: 10.96.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      nginx
Address 1: 10.109.24.56 nginx.default.svc.cluster.local

The IP address returned for the service should correspond to its cluster IP.
