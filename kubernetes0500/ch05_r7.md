## Problem

You want to deploy an ingress controller on Minikube to learn about `Ingress` objects. `Ingress` objects are of interest to you because you want to provide access to your applications running in Kubernetes from outside your Kubernetes cluster; however, you do not want to create a `NodePort`\- or `LoadBalancer`\-type service.

## Solution

For `Ingress` objects (discussed in [Making Services Accessible from Outside the Cluster](#ingress)) to take effect and provide a route from outside the cluster to your pods, you need to deploy an ingress controller.

On Minikube, enable the ingress add-on like so:

$ **minikube addons enable ingress**

Once done, you should see ingress appear as enabled in the list of Minikube add-ons. Check that this is the case with:

$ **minikube addons list | grep ingress**
- ingress: enabled

After a minute or less, two new pods will start in your `kube-system` namespace:

$ **kubectl get pods -n kube-system**
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-http-backend-6tv69       1/1       Running   1          1d
...
nginx-ingress-controller-95dqr   1/1       Running   1          1d
...

You are now ready to create `Ingress` objects.
