A service provides a [stable virtual IP (VIP) address](https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-services-by-example/) for a set of pods. Though pods may come and go, services allow clients to reliably discover and connect to the containers running in the pods by using the VIP. The "virtual" in VIP means it’s not an actual IP address connected to a network interface; its purpose is purely to forward traffic to one or more pods. Keeping the mapping between the VIP and the pods up to date is the job of `kube-proxy`, a process that runs on every node on the cluster. This `kube-proxy` process queries the API server to learn about new services in the cluster and updates the node’s iptables rules (iptables) accordingly, to provide the necessary routing information.
