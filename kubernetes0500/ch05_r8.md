## Problem

You want to access a Kubernetes service from outside of the cluster.

## Solution

Use an ingress controller (see [Deploying an Ingress Controller on Minikube](#ingress_controller)), which is configured by creating Ingress objects. The following shows the manifest of an Ingress rule that configures a path to an nginx service:

$ **cat nginx-ingress.yaml**
kind:                                     Ingress
apiVersion:                               extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:                                   nginx-public
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host:
    http:
      paths:
      - path:                             /web
        backend:
          serviceName:                    nginx
          servicePort:                    80

$ **kubectl create -f nginx-ingress.yaml**

Now you can see the Ingress object created for nginx in your Kubernetes dashboard ([Screenshot of the nginx ingress object](#nginx-ingress-screenshot)).

From the Kubernetes dashboard, you can see that nginx will be available via the IP address 192.168.99.100, and the manifest file defines that it should be exposed via the path `/web`. Based on this information, you can access nginx from outside the cluster now as follows:

$ **curl -k https://192.168.99.100/web**
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

## Discussion

In general, ingress works as depicted in [Ingress concept](#ingress-concept): the ingress controller listens to the `/ingresses` endpoint of the API server, learning about new rules. It then configures the routes so that external traffic lands at a specific (cluster-internal) service—`service1` on port 9876 in our example.

Note

This recipe uses Minishift, where an ingress controller add-on is readily available. Usually, you’ll need to set up an ingress controller yourself; see for example the [instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx).
