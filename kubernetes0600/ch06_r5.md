## Problem

You want to label an object in order to find it later on. The label can be used for further end-user queries (see [Using Labels for Queries](#labels)) or in the context of system automation.

## Solution

Use the `kubectl label` command. For example, to label a pod named `foobar` with the key/value pair `tier=frontend`, do this:

$ **kubectl label pods foobar tier=frontend**

Tip

Check the complete help for the command (`kubectl label --help`). You can use it to find out how to remove labels, overwrite existing ones, and even label all resources in a namespace.

## Discussion

In Kubernetes, you use labels to organize objects in a flexible, nonhierarchical manner. A label is a key/value pair without any predefined meaning for Kubernetes. In other words, the content of the key/value pair is not interpreted by the system. You can use labels to express membership (e.g., object X belongs to department ABC), environments (e.g., this service runs in production), or really anything you need to organize your objects. Note that labels do have restrictions concerning their length and allowed values.\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\]
