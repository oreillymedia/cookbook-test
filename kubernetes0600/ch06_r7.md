## Problem

You want to annotate a resource with a generic, nonidentifying key/value pair, possibly using nonhuman readable data.

## Solution

Use the `kubectl annotate` command:

$ **kubectl annotate pods foobar \\
description='something that you can use for automation'**

## Discussion

Annotations tend to be used for added automation of Kubernetes. For example, when you create a deployment with the `kubectl run` command and you forget to use the `--record` option, you will notice that the change-cause column in your rollout history (see [\[updating-deployments\]](#updating-deployments)) is empty. As of Kubernetes v1.6.0, to start recording the commands that cause changes to the deployment, you can annotate it with the kubernetes.io/change-cause key. Given a deployment `foobar`, you might annotate it with:

$ **kubectl annotate deployment foobar \\
kubernetes.io/change-cause="Reason for creating a new revision"**

Subsequent changes to the deployment will be recorded.
