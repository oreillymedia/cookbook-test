## Problem

While Kubernetes has a few convenience generators with `kubectl run` and `kubectl create`, you need to learn how to write Kubernetes manifests, expressing Kubernetes object specifications. To do this, you need to understand the general structure of manifests.

## Solution

In [Discovering API Endpoints of the Kubernetes API Server](#api_endpoints), you learned about the various API groups and how to discover which group a particular object is in.

All API resources are either objects or lists. All resources have a `kind` and an `apiVersion`. In addition, every object `kind` must have `metadata`. The `metadata` contains the name of the object, the namespace it is in (see [Creating Namespaces to Avoid Name Collisions](#namespace)), and potentially some labels (see [Using Labels for Queries](#labels)) and annotations (see [Annotating a Resource with One Command](#easy_annotate)).

A pod, for example, will be of `kind Pod` and `apiVersion v1`, and the beginning of a simple manifest written in YAML will look like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
...
```{{execute}}

To complete a manifest, most objects will have a `spec` and, once created, will also return a `status`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
```{{execute}}
