In this chapter, we present recipes that address the basic interaction with Kubernetes objects as well as the API. Every object in Kubernetes, no matter if namespaced like a deployment or cluster-wide like a node, has certain fields available—​for example, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status`.\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\] The `spec` describes the desired state for an object (the specification), and the `status` captures the actual state of the object, managed by the Kubernetes API server.
