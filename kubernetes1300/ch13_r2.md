## Problem

You want to build a specific component of Kubernetes from source, not all the components—​for example, you only want to build the client `kubectl`.

## Solution

Instead of using `make quick-release` or simply `make`, as shown in [Compiling from Source](#compiling_source), do `make kubectl`.

There are targets in the root _Makefile_ to build individual components. For example to compile `kubectl`, `kubeadm`, and `hyperkube`, do this:

$ **make kubectl**
$ **make kubeadm**
$ **make hyperkube**

The binaries will be located in the _\_output/bin_ directory.
