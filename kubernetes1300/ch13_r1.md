## Problem

You want to package your own Kubernetes binaries from source instead of downloading the official release binaries (see [\[get\_binaries\]](#get_binaries)) or third-party artifacts.

## Solution

Clone the Kubernetes Git repository and build from source.

If you are on a Docker host, you can use the `quick-release` target of the root _Makefile_ as shown here:

$ **git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes**
$ **cd kubernetes**
$ **make quick-release**

Tip

This Docker-based build requires at least 4 GB of RAM to complete. Ensure that your Docker daemon has access to that much memory. On macOS, access the Docker for Mac preferences and increase the allocated RAM.

The binaries will be located in the _\_output/release-stage_ directory and a complete bundle will be in the _\_output/release-tars_ directory.

Or, if you have a [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) environment properly set up, use the `release` target of the root _Makefile_:

$ **git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/Kubernetes**
$ **cd kubernetes**
$ **make**

The binaries will be located in the _\_output/bin_ directory.
