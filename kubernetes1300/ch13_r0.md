Now that youâ€™ve seen how to install, interact with, and use Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications, we focus in this chapter on adapting Kubernetes to your needs as well as fixing bugs in Kubernetes. For this, you will need [Go](http://golang.org) installed and access to the Kubernetes source code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). We show how to compile Kubernetes (as a whole) and also show how to compile specific components like the client `kubectl`. We also demonstrate how to use Python to talk to the Kubernetes API server and show how to extend Kubernetes with a custom resource definition.
