## Problem

You want to run a process that runs for a certain time to completion, such as a batch conversion, backup operation, or database schema upgrade.

## Solution

Use a Kubernetes job resource to launch and supervise the pod(s) that will carry out the batch process.\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\]

First, define the Kubernetes manifest for the job in a file called _counter-batch-job.yaml_:

```
apiVersion:          batch/v1
kind:                Job
metadata:
  name:              counter
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name:          counter
    spec:
      containers:
      - name:        counter
        image:       busybox
        command:
         - "sh"
         - "-c"
         - "for i in 1 2 3 ; do echo $i ; done"
      restartPolicy: Never
```{{execute}}

Then launch the job and have a look at its status:

$ **kubectl create -f counter-batch-job.yaml**
job "counter" created

$ **kubectl get jobs**
NAME      DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
counter   1         1            22s

$ **kubectl describe jobs/counter**
Name:           counter
Namespace:      default

                job-name=counter
  Containers:
   counter:
    Image:      busybox
    Port:       <none>
    Command:
      sh
      -c
      for i in 1 2 3 ; do echo $i ; done
    Environment:        <none>
    Mounts:             <none>
  Volumes:              <none>
Events:
  FirstSeen  ...  ...  ...  Type    Reason            Message
  ---------  ...  ...  ...  ------  ------            -------
  31s        ...  ...  ...  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  Created pod: counter-0pt20

Finally, you want to verify that it actually carried out the task (counting from 1 to 3):

$ **kubectl logs jobs/counter**
1
2
3

Indeed, as you can see, the `counter` job counted as expected.

If you donâ€™t need the job anymore, use `kubectl delete jobs/counter` to remove it.
