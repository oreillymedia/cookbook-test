## Problem

You want to run an app that requires that its pods have distinct, potentially different characteristics, such as a database where you have a leader handling reads and writes and several followers that only serve reads. You can’t use deployments because they only supervise identical pods, and you need a supervisor that can deal with pods that are more like pets than cattle.

## Solution

Use a `StatefulSet`, which enables workloads with unique network names, graceful deployment/scaling/termination, or persistent storage. For example, to run the popular scalable datastore CockroachDB, you can use the provided example,\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\] which contains at its core the following `StatefulSet`:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind:                        StatefulSet
metadata:
  name:                      cockroachdb
spec:
  serviceName:               "cockroachdb"
  replicas:                  3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app:                 cockroachdb
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name:                bootstrap
        image:               cockroachdb/cockroach-k8s-init:0.2
        imagePullPolicy:     IfNotPresent
        args:
        - "-on-start=/on-start.sh"
        - "-service=cockroachdb"
        env:
        - name:              POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath:     metadata.namespace
        volumeMounts:
        - name: datadir
          mountPath:         "/cockroach/cockroach-data"
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 100
            podAffinityTerm:
              labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                - key: app
                  operator:  In
                  values:
                  - cockroachdb
              topologyKey:   kubernetes.io/hostname
      containers:
      - name:                cockroachdb
        image:               cockroachdb/cockroach:v1.0.3
        imagePullPolicy:     IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort:     26257
          name: grpc
        - containerPort:     8080
          name: http
        volumeMounts:
        - name: datadir
          mountPath:         /cockroach/cockroach-data
        command:
          - "/bin/bash"
          - "-ecx"
          - |
            if [ ! "$(hostname)" == "cockroachdb-0" ] || \
               [ -e "/cockroach/cockroach-data/cluster_exists_marker" ]
            then
              CRARGS+=("--join" "cockroachdb-public")
            fi
            exec /cockroach/cockroach ${CRARGS[*]}
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
      volumes:
      - name:                 datadir
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName:          datadir
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name:                   datadir
      annotations:
        volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class: anything
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - "ReadWriteOnce"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage:            1Gi
```{{execute}}

To launch it, do this:

$ **curl -s -o cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml \\
             https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/ \\
             examples/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml**

$ **curl -s -o crex.sh \\
             https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/ \\
             examples/cockroachdb/minikube.sh**

$ **./crex.sh**
+ kubectl delete statefulsets,persistentvolumes,persistentvolumeclaims,services...
...
+ kubectl create -f -
persistentvolumeclaim "datadir-cockroachdb-3" created
+ kubectl create -f cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml
service "cockroachdb-public" created
service "cockroachdb" created
poddisruptionbudget "cockroachdb-budget" created
statefulset "cockroachdb" created

Now you can see the `StatefulSet` object created along with the pods in the Kubernetes dashboard ([Screenshot of a StatefulSet](#statefulset-screenshot)).

## Discussion

Originally, what is now known in Kubernetes as a `StatefulSet` was called a `PetSet`. This should give you an idea of what the motivation was. In Kubernetes 1.7, the `StatefulSet` became a beta feature, which means that the API is not going to change anymore; only UX fixes are to be expected. A `StatefulSet` is a controller that provides unique identities to the pods it is supervising. Note that, as a safety measure, deleting a `StatefulSet` will not delete the volumes associated with it.

Another use case for a `StatefulSet`, found quite often in the wild, is to run an app that was not written with Kubernetes in mind. Such apps are sometimes called _legacy apps_, from a Kubernetes perspective. We will refer to these apps as non-cloud-native apps going forward. Using `StatefulSet` is a good way to supervise such an app.
