## Problem

You want to launch an infrastructure daemon—​for example, a log collector or monitoring agent—​making sure that exactly one pod runs per node.

## Solution

Use a `DaemonSet` to launch and supervise the daemon process. For example, to launch a Fluentd agent on each node in your cluster, create a file named _fluentd-daemonset.yaml_ with the following content:

```
kind:                 DaemonSet
apiVersion:           extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:               fluentd
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app:          fluentd
      name:           fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name:         fluentd
        image:        gcr.io/google_containers/fluentd-elasticsearch:1.3
        env:
         - name:      FLUENTD_ARGS
           value:     -qq
        volumeMounts:
         - name:      varlog
           mountPath: /varlog
         - name:      containers
           mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
      volumes:
         - hostPath:
             path:    /var/log
           name:      varlog
         - hostPath:
             path:    /var/lib/docker/containers
           name:      containers
```{{execute}}

Now launch the `DaemonSet`, like so:

$ **kubectl create -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml**
daemonset "fluentd" created

$ **kubectl get ds**
NAME     DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  NODE-SELECTOR  AGE
fluentd  1        1        1      1           1          <none>         17s

$ **kubectl describe ds/fluentd**
Name:           fluentd
Selector:       app=fluentd
Node-Selector:  <none>
Labels:         app=fluentd
Annotations:    <none>
Desired Number of Nodes Scheduled: 1
Current Number of Nodes Scheduled: 1
Number of Nodes Scheduled with Up-to-date Pods: 1
Number of Nodes Scheduled with Available Pods: 1
Number of Nodes Misscheduled: 0
Pods Status:    1 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
...

## Discussion

Note that in the preceding output, because the command is executed on Minikube, you only see one pod running as there’s only one node in this setup. If you had 15 nodes in your cluster, you’d have 15 pods overall with 1 pod per node running. You can also restrict the daemon to certain nodes using the `nodeSelector` section in the `spec` of the `DaemonSet` manifest.
