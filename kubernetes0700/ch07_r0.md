In [\[ch\_fundamental\_workloads\]](#ch_fundamental_workloads), we explored how to launch applications that are supposed to run forever, such as a web server or an app server. In this chapter, we will discuss workloads that are somewhat more specialized—​for example, ones that launch terminating processes such as batch jobs, run pods on certain nodes, or manage stateful and noncloud native apps.
