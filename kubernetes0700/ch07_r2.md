## Problem

You want to run a task on a specific schedule within a pod managed by Kubernetes.

## Solution

Use Kubernetes `CronJob` objects. The `CronJob` object is a derivative of the more generic `Job` object (see [Running a Batch Job](#run_job)).

You can periodically schedule a job by writing a manifest similar to the one shown here. In the `spec`, you see a `schedule` section that follows the crontab format. The `template` section describes the pod that will run and the command that will get executed (it prints the current date and time every hour to `stdout`):

```
apiVersion:              batch/v2alpha1
kind:                    CronJob
metadata:
  name:                  hourly-date
spec:
  schedule:              "0 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name:        date
            image:       busybox
            command:
              - "sh"
              - "-c"
              - "date"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```{{execute}}
