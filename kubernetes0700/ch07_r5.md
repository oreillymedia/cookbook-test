## Problem

Your pod depends on some other service being available in order to function properly.

## Solution

Use [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) to influence the startup behavior of a pod.

Imagine you want to launch an nginx web server that depends on a backend service to serve content. You therefore want to make sure that the nginx pod only starts up once the backend service is up and running.

First, create the backend service the web server depends on:

$ **kubectl run backend --image=mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0**
deployment "backend" created

$ **kubectl expose deployment backend --port=80 --target-port=9876**

Then you can use the following manifest, _nginx-init-container.yaml_, to launch the nginx instance and make sure it starts up only when the `backend` deployment serves data:

```
kind:                 Deployment
apiVersion:           apps/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:               nginx
spec:
  replicas:           1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app:          nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name:         webserver
        image:        nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      initContainers:
      - name:         checkbackend
        image:        busybox
        command:      ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup backend.default.svc; do echo
                       "Waiting for backend to come up"; sleep 3; done; echo
                       "Backend is up, ready to launch web server"']
```{{execute}}

Now you can launch the `nginx` deployment and verify whether the init container has done its job by looking at the logs of the pod it is supervising:

$ **kubectl create -f nginx-init-container.yaml**
deployment "nginx" created

$ **kubectl get po**
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backend-853383893-2g0gs   1/1       Running   0          43m
nginx-2101406530-jwghn    1/1       Running   0          10m

$ **kubectl logs nginx-2101406530-jwghn -c checkbackend**
Server:    10.0.0.10
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      backend.default.svc
Address 1: 10.0.0.46 backend.default.svc.cluster.local
Backend is up, ready to launch web server

As you can see, the command in the init container indeed worked as planned.
