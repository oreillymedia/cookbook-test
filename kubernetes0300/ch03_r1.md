## Problem

You want to list Kubernetes resources of a certain kind.

## Solution

Use the `get` verb of `kubectl` along with the resource type. To list all pods:

$ **kubectl get pods**

To list all services and deployments:

$ **kubectl get services,deployments**

To list a specific deployment:

$ **kubectl get deployment myfirstk8sapp**

To list all resources:

$ **kubectl get all**

Note that `kubectl get` is a very basic but extremely useful command to get a quick overview what is going on in the cluster—​it’s essentially the equivalent to `ps` on Unix.

Tip

Many resources have short names you can use with `kubectl`, sparing your time and sanity. Here are some examples:

*   configmaps (aka cm)
    
*   daemonsets (aka ds)
    
*   deployments (aka deploy)
    
*   endpoints (aka ep)
    
*   events (aka ev)
    
*   horizontalpodautoscalers (aka hpa)
    
*   ingresses (aka ing)
    
*   namespaces (aka ns)
    
*   nodes (aka no)
    
*   persistentvolumeclaims (aka pvc)
    
*   persistentvolumes (aka pv)
    
*   pods (aka po)
    
*   replicasets (aka rs)
    
*   replicationcontrollers (aka rc)
    
*   resourcequotas (aka quota)
    
*   serviceaccounts (aka sa)
    
*   services (aka svc)
