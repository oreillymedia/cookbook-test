## Problem

You want to watch the changes to Kubernetes objects in an interactive manner in the terminal.

## Solution

The `kubectl` command has a `--watch` option that gives you this behavior. For example, to watch pods:

$ **kubectl get pods --watch**

Note that this is a blocking and autoupdating command, akin to `top`.

## Discussion

The --watch option is useful, but sometimes not very reliable, in terms of refreshing the screen correctly. Alternatively, you can use the [`watch`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/watch.1.html) command, as in:

$ **watch kubectl get pods**
