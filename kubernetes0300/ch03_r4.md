## Problem

You want to update the property of a Kubernetes resource.

## Solution

Use the `edit` verb of `kubectl` along with the resource type:

$ **kubectl run nginx --image=nginx**
$ **kubectl edit deploy/nginx**

Now edit the nginx deployment in your editor—​for example, change replicas to 2. Once you save, you’ll see something like:

deployment "nginx" edited

## Discussion

If you have editor issues, use `EDITOR=vi`. Also be aware that not all changes trigger a deployment.

Some triggers have shortcuts, for example, if you want to change the image version a deployment uses, simply use `kubectl set image`, which updates the existing container images of resources (valid for deployments, replica sets/replication controllers, daemon sets, jobs, and simple pods).
