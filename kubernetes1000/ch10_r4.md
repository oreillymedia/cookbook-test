## Problem

For a given user or application, you want to allow or deny a certain action, such as viewing secrets or updating a deployment.

## Solution

Let’s assume you want to restrict an app to only be able to view pods—​that is, list pods and get details about pods.

You’d start off with a pod definition in a YAML manifest, _pod-with-sa.yaml_, using a dedicated service account, `myappsa` (see [Providing a Unique Identity for an Application](#service_accounts)):

```
kind:                 Pod
apiVersion:           v1
metadata:
  name:               myapp
  namespace:          sec
spec:
  serviceAccountName: myappsa
  containers:
  - name:             main
    image:            centos:7
    command:
      - "bin/bash"
      - "-c"
      - "sleep 10000"
```{{execute}}

Next, you’d define a role—let’s call it `podreader` in the manifest _pod-reader.yaml_—that defines the allowed actions on resources:

```
kind:        Role
apiVersion:  rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:      podreader
  namespace: sec
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs:     ["get", "list"]
```{{execute}}

Last but not least you need to apply the role `podreader` to the service account `myappsa`, using a role binding in _pod-reader-binding.yaml_:

```
kind:        RoleBinding
apiVersion:  rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:      podreaderbinding
  namespace: sec
roleRef:
  apiGroup:  rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind:      Role
  name:      podreader
subjects:
- kind:      ServiceAccount
  name:      myappsa
  namespace: sec
```{{execute}}

When creating the respective resources, you can use the YAML manifests directly (assuming the service account has already been created):

$ **kubectl create -f pod-reader.yaml**
$ **kubectl create -f pod-reader-binding.yaml**
$ **kubectl create -f pod-with-sa.yaml**

Rather than creating manifests for the role and the role binding, you can use the following commands:

$ **kubectl create role podreader \\
          --verb=get --verb=list \\
          --resource=pods -n=sec**

$ **kubectl create rolebinding podreaderbinding \\
          --role=sec:podreader \\
          --serviceaccount=sec:myappsa \\
          --namespace=sec -n=sec**

Note that this is a case of namespaced access control setup, since you’re using roles and role bindings. For cluster-wide access control, you’d use the corresponding `create clusterrole` and `create clusterrolebinding` commands.

Tip

Sometimes it’s not obvious if you should use a role or a cluster role and/or role binding, so here are a few rules of thumb you might find useful:

*   If you want to restrict access to a namespaced resource (like a service or pod) in a certain namespace, use a role and a role binding (as we did in this recipe).
    
*   If you want to reuse a role in a couple of namespaces, use a cluster role with a role binding.
    
*   If you want to restrict access to cluster-wide resources such as nodes or to namespaced resources across all namespaces, use a cluster role with a cluster role binding.
