## Problem

Your pods are up and running according to the liveness probes (see [Recover from a Broken State with a Liveness Probe](#liveness)), but you only want to send traffic to them if the application is ready to serve the requests.

## Solution

Add readiness probes to your pod specifications.\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\] Similar to liveness probes, readiness probes can be of three types (see the documentation for details). The following is a straightforward example of running a single pod with the nginx Docker image. The readiness probe makes an HTTP request to port 80:

```
apiVersion:   v1
kind:         Pod
metadata:
  name:       readiness-nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name:     readiness
    image:    nginx
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path:  /
        port:  80
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

While the readiness probe shown in this recipe is the same as the liveness probe in [Recover from a Broken State with a Liveness Probe](#liveness), they typically should be different as the two probes aim to give information about different aspects of the application. The liveness probe checks to see that the application process is alive, but it may not be ready to accept requests. The readiness probe checks that the application is serving requests properly. As such, only when a readiness probe passes does the pod become part of a service (see [\[simple\_service\]](#simple_service)).
