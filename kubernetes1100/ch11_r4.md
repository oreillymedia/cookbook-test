## Problem

You want to make sure that if the applications running inside some of your pods get into a broken state, Kubernetes restarts the pods automatically.

## Solution

Use a liveness probe.\[[3](#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\] If the probe fails, the kubelet will restart the pod automatically. The probe is part of the pod specification and is added to the containers section. Each container in a pod can have a liveness probe.

A probe can be of three different types: it can be a command that is executed inside the container, an HTTP request to a specific route served by a web server inside the container, or a more generic TCP probe.

In the following example, we show a basic HTTP probe:

```
apiVersion:   v1
kind:         Pod
metadata:
  name:       liveness-nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name:     liveness
    image:    nginx
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
```{{execute}}

See [Adding Liveness and Readiness Probes to Your Deployments](#liveness_readiness_probes) for a complete example.
