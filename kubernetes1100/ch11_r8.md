## Problem

You want to view and query the system and application metrics of your cluster in a central place.

## Solution

Use Prometheus as follows:

1.  Create a config map holding the Prometheus configuration.
    
2.  Set up a service account for Prometheus and assign permissions via RBAC (see [\[access\_control\]](#access_control)) to the service account (see [\[service\_accounts\]](#service_accounts)) allowing access to all metrics.
    
3.  Create an app consisting of a deployment, a service, and an Ingress resource for Prometheus so that you can access it via a browser from outside the cluster.
    

First, you need to set up the Prometheus configuration via a ConfigMap object (see [\[configmaps\]](#configmaps) for an introduction to config maps). You will be using this later in the Prometheus app. Create a file called _prometheus.yml_, holding the Prometheus configuration, with the following content:

```
global:
  scrape_interval:        5s
  evaluation_interval:    5s
scrape_configs:
- job_name:               'kubernetes-nodes'
  scheme:                 https
  tls_config:
    ca_file:              /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    server_name:          'gke-k8scb-default-pool-be16f9ee-522p'
    insecure_skip_verify: true
  bearer_token_file:      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role:                 node
  relabel_configs:
  - action:               labelmap
    regex:                __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
- job_name:               'kubernetes-cadvisor'
  scheme:                 https
  tls_config:
    ca_file:              /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
  bearer_token_file:      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role:                 node
  relabel_configs:
  - action:               labelmap
    regex:                __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
  - target_label:         __address__
    replacement:          kubernetes.default.svc:443
  - source_labels:        [__meta_kubernetes_node_name]
    regex:                (.+)
    target_label:         __metrics_path__
    replacement:          /api/v1/nodes/${1}:4194/proxy/metrics
```{{execute}}

We can use this to create a config map, like so:

$ **kubectl create configmap prom-config-cm --from-file=prometheus.yml**

Next, set up the Prometheus service account and role binding (permissions) in a manifest file called _prometheus-rbac.yaml_, as follows:

```
apiVersion:  v1
kind:        ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name:      prometheus
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion:  rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind:        ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name:      prometheus
roleRef:
  apiGroup:  rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind:      ClusterRole
  name:      cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind:      ServiceAccount
  name:      prometheus
  namespace: default
```{{execute}}

Using this manifest, you can now create the service account and role binding:

$ **kubectl create -f prometheus-rbac.yaml**

Now that you have all the prerequisites sorted (configuration and access permissions), you can move on to the Prometheus app itself. Remember, the app consists of a deployment, a service, and an Ingress resource and uses the config map and service account you created in the previous steps.

Next, define the Prometheus app manifest in _prometheus-app.yaml_:

```
kind:                                     Deployment
apiVersion:                               extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:                                   prom
  namespace:                              default
  labels:
    app:                                  prom
spec:
  replicas:                               1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app:                                prom
  template:
    metadata:
      name:                               prom
      labels:
        app:                              prom
    spec:
      serviceAccount:                     prometheus
      containers:
      - name:                             prom
        image:                            prom/prometheus
        imagePullPolicy:                  Always
        volumeMounts:
        - name:                           prometheus-volume-1
          mountPath:                      "/prometheus"
        - name:                           prom-config-volume
          mountPath:                      "/etc/prometheus/"
      volumes:
      - name:                             prometheus-volume-1
        emptyDir:                         {}
      - name:                             prom-config-volume
        configMap:
          name:                           prom-config-cm
          defaultMode:                    420
---
kind:                                     Service
apiVersion:                               v1
metadata:
  name:                                   prom-svc
  labels:
    app:                                  prom
spec:
  ports:
  - port:                                 80
    targetPort:                           9090
  selector:
    app:                                  prom
  type:                                   LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy:                  Cluster
---
kind:                                     Ingress
apiVersion:                               extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name:                                   prom-public
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host:
    http:
      paths:
      - path:                             /
        backend:
          serviceName:                    prom-svc
          servicePort:                    80
```{{execute}}

And now create the app from the manifest:

$ **kubectl create -f prometheus-app.yaml**

Congratulations—​you just created a full-fledged app! Now you can access Prometheus via `$MINISHIFT_IP/graph` (for example, `[https://192.168.99.100/graph](https://192.168.99.100/graph)`), and you should see something like in [Prometheus screenshot](#prometheus-screenshot).

## Discussion

Prometheus is a powerful and flexible monitoring and alerting system. You can use it—​or better, one of the many [instrumentation libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/)—to make your own app report higher-level metrics such as, the number of transactions performed, just like the way, say, a kubelet reports the CPU usage.

While Prometheus is fast and scalable, you probable want to use something else to visualize the metrics. The canonical way to do this is to [connect it with Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/).

Warning

There is a known [issue](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2916) with using Prometheus with Kubernetes versions 1.7.0 through 1.7.2, as the kubelet's behavior concerning exposing container metrics changed in v1.7.0.

Note that the Prometheus config shown in the Solution is valid for v1.7.0 to v1.7.2; if you’re using v1.7.3 or later, you want to check out the [example Prometheus configuration file](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml#L88) for details on what you need to change.

Note that the solution described here is not limited to Minikube. In fact, as long as you can create the service account (that is, you have sufficient rights to give Prometheus the necessary permissions), you can apply the same solution to environments such as GKE, ACS, or OpenShift.
