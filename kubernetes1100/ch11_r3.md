## Problem

You want to access the logs of the application running inside a container that is running in a specific pod.

## Solution

Use the `kubectl logs` command. To see the various options, check the usage, like so:

$ **kubectl logs --help | more**
Print the logs for a container in a pod or specified resource. If the pod has only
one container, the container name is optional.

Aliases:
logs, log

Examples:
  # Return snapshot logs from pod nginx with only one container
  kubectl logs nginx
...

For example, given a pod started by a deployment (see [\[kubectl\_run\]](#kubectl_run)), you can check the logs like so:

$ **kubectl get pods**
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ghost-8449997474-kn86m         1/1       Running   0          1m

$ **kubectl logs ghost-8449997474-kn86m**
\[2017-12-16 18:44:18\] INFO Creating table: posts
\[2017-12-16 18:44:18\] INFO Creating table: users
\[2017-12-16 18:44:18\] INFO Creating table: roles
\[2017-12-16 18:44:18\] INFO Creating table: roles\_users
...

Tip

If a pod has multiple containers, you can get the logs of any of them by specifying the name of the container using the `-c` option of `kubectl logs`.
