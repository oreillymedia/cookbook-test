## Problem

You want to view and query the logs of all of the apps in your cluster in a central place.

## Solution

Use Elasticsearch, [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) as described here.

As preparation, make sure Minikube has enough resources assigned. For example, use `--cpus=4 --memory=4000` and make sure the ingress add-on is enabled, like so:

$ **minikube start**
Starting local Kubernetes v1.7.0 cluster...
Starting VM...
Getting VM IP address...
Moving files into cluster...
Setting up certs...
Starting cluster components...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.

$ **minikube addons list | grep ingress**
- ingress: enabled

If the add-on is not enabled, enable it:

$ ** minikube addons enable ingress**

Next, create a manifest file called _efk-logging.yaml_ with the following content:

```

        env:
         - name:                          FLUENTD_ARGS
           value:                         -qq
        volumeMounts:
         - name:                          varlog
           mountPath:                     /varlog
         - name:                          containers
           mountPath:                     /var/lib/docker/containers
      volumes:
         - hostPath:
             path:                        /var/log
           name:                          varlog
         - hostPath:
             path:                        /var/lib/docker/containers
           name:                          containers
```{{execute}}

Now you can launch the EFK stack:

$ **kubectl create -f efk-logging.yaml**

Once everything has started up, log in to Kibana with the following credentials:

*   Username: `kibana`
    
*   Password: `changeme`
    

Visit the Discover tab at `[https://$IP/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(](https://$IP/app/kibana#/discover?_g=())` and start exploring the logs from there.

If you want to clean up and/or restart the EFK stack, use the following:

$ **kubectl delete deploy/es && \\
  kubectl delete deploy/kibana && \\
  kubectl delete svc/elasticsearch && \\
  kubectl delete svc/kibana && \\
  kubectl delete ingress/kibana-public && \\
  kubectl delete daemonset/fluentd**

## Discussion

The log shipping can also be done using Logstash. We chose to use Fluentd in the Solution because it’s a CNCF project and is gaining a lot of traction.

Note that Kibana can take some time to come up, and you might need to reload the web app a couple of times before you get to the configuration bits.
