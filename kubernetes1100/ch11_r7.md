## Problem

You want to use the `kubectl top` command in Minikube to monitor resource usage, but it appears that the Heapster add-on is not running:

$ **kubectl top pods**
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource
(get services http:heapster:)

## Solution

The latest versions of the `minikube` command include an add-on manager, which lets you enable Heapster—as well as a few other add-ons, such as an ingress controller—with a single command:

$ **minikube addons enable heapster**

Enabling the Heapster add-on triggers the creation of two pods in the `kube-system` namespace: one pod running Heapster and another pod running an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) time-series database along with a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana) dashboard.

After some minutes, once the first metrics have been collected, the `kubectl top` command will return resource metrics as expected:

$ **kubectl top node**
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%      MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
minikube   187m         9%        1154Mi          60%

$ **kubectl top pods --all-namespaces**
NAMESPACE     NAME                             CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
default       ghost-2663835528-fb044           0m           140Mi
kube-system   kube-dns-v20-4bkhn               3m           12Mi
kube-system   heapster-6j5m8                   0m           21Mi
kube-system   influxdb-grafana-vw9x1           23m          37Mi
kube-system   kube-addon-manager-minikube      47m          3Mi
kube-system   kubernetes-dashboard-scsnx       0m           14Mi
kube-system   default-http-backend-75m71       0m           1Mi
kube-system   nginx-ingress-controller-p8fmd   4m           51Mi

Now you will also be able to access the Grafana dashboard and customize it to your liking:

$ **minikube service monitoring-grafana -n kube-system**
Waiting, endpoint for service is not ready yet...
Waiting, endpoint for service is not ready yet...
Waiting, endpoint for service is not ready yet...
Waiting, endpoint for service is not ready yet...
Opening kubernetes service kube-system/monitoring-grafana in default browser...

As a result of this command, your default browser should automagically open and you should see something like [Screenshot of the Grafana dashboard, showing Minikube metrics](#minikube-grafana-dashboard).

Note that you can drill into the metrics in Grafana at this point.
