## Problem

You have a class that only defines a single method besides `_init_()`. However, to simplify your code, you would much rather just have a simple function.

## Solution

In many cases, single-method classes can be turned into functions using closures. Consider, as an example, the following class, which allows a user to fetch URLs using a kind of templating scheme.

```
from urllib.request import urlopen

class UrlTemplate(object):
    def __init__(self, template):
        self.template = template
    def open(self, **kwargs):
        return urlopen(self.template.format_map(kwargs))

# Example use. Download stock data from yahoo
yahoo = UrlTemplate('http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s={names}&f={fields}')
for line in yahoo.open(names='IBM,AAPL,FB', fields='sl1c1v'):
    print(line.decode('utf-8'))
```{{execute}}

The class could be replaced with a much simpler function:

```
def urltemplate(template):
    def opener(**kwargs):
        return urlopen(template.format_map(kwargs))
    return opener

# Example use
yahoo = urltemplate('http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s={names}&f={fields}')
for line in yahoo(names='IBM,AAPL,FB', fields='sl1c1v'):
    print(line.decode('utf-8'))
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

In many cases, the only reason you might have a single-method class is to store additional state for use in the method. For example, the only purpose of the `UrlTemplate` class is to hold the `template` value someplace so that it can be used in the `open()` method.

Using an inner function or closure, as shown in the solution, is often more elegant. Simply stated, a closure is just a function, but with an extra environment of the variables that are used inside the function. A key feature of a closure is that it remembers the environment in which it was defined. Thus, in the solution, the `opener()` function remembers the value of the `template` argument, and uses it in subsequent calls.

Whenever youâ€™re writing code and you encounter the problem of attaching additional state to a function, think closures. They are often a more minimal and elegant solution than the alternative of turning your function into a full-fledged class.
