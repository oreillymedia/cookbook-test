## Problem

You want to read or write data encoded as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

## Solution

The `json` module provides an easy way to encode and decode data in JSON. The two main functions are `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()`, mirroring the interface used in other serialization libraries, such as `pickle`. Here is how you turn a Python data structure into JSON:

```
import json

data = {
   'name' : 'ACME',
   'shares' : 100,
   'price' : 542.23
}

json_str = json.dumps(data)
```{{execute}}

Here is how you turn a JSON-encoded string back into a Python data structure:

```
data = json.loads(json_str)
```{{execute}}

If you are working with files instead of strings, you can alternatively use `json.dump()` and `json.load()` to encode and decode JSON data. For example:

```
# Writing JSON data
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
     json.dump(data, f)

# Reading data back
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
     data = json.load(f)
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

JSON encoding supports the basic types of `None`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `str`, as well as lists, tuples, and dictionaries containing those types. For dictionaries, keys are assumed to be strings (any nonstring keys in a dictionary are converted to strings when encoding). To be compliant with the JSON specification, you should only encode Python lists and dictionaries. Moreover, in web applications, it is standard practice for the top-level object to be a dictionary.

The format of JSON encoding is almost identical to Python syntax except for a few minor changes. For instance, `True` is mapped to `true`, `False` is mapped to `false`, and `None` is mapped to `null`. Here is an example that shows what the encoding looks like:

```
>>> json.dumps(False)
'false'
>>> d = {'a': True,
...      'b': 'Hello',
...      'c': None}
>>> json.dumps(d)
'{"b": "Hello", "c": null, "a": true}'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you are trying to examine data you have decoded from JSON, it can often be hard to ascertain its structure simply by printing it out—​especially if the data contains a deep level of nested structures or a lot of fields. To assist with this, consider using the `pprint()` function in the `pprint` module. This will alphabetize the keys and output a dictionary in a more sane way. Here is an example that illustrates how you would pretty print the results of a search on Twitter:

```
>>> from urllib.request import urlopen
>>> import json
>>> u = urlopen('http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=python&rpp=5')
>>> resp = json.loads(u.read().decode('utf-8'))
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> pprint(resp)
{'completed_in': 0.074,
 'max_id': 264043230692245504,
 'max_id_str': '264043230692245504',
 'next_page': '?page=2&max_id=264043230692245504&q=python&rpp=5',
 'page': 1,
 'query': 'python',
 'refresh_url': '?since_id=264043230692245504&q=python',
 'results': [{'created_at': 'Thu, 01 Nov 2012 16:36:26 +0000',
              'from_user': ...
             },
             {'created_at': 'Thu, 01 Nov 2012 16:36:14 +0000',
              'from_user': ...
             },
             {'created_at': 'Thu, 01 Nov 2012 16:36:13 +0000',
              'from_user': ...
             },
             {'created_at': 'Thu, 01 Nov 2012 16:36:07 +0000',
              'from_user': ...
             },
             {'created_at': 'Thu, 01 Nov 2012 16:36:04 +0000',
              'from_user': ...
             }],
 'results_per_page': 5,
 'since_id': 0,
 'since_id_str': '0'}
>>>
```{{execute}}

Normally, JSON decoding will create dicts or lists from the supplied data. If you want to create different kinds of objects, supply the `object_pairs_hook` or `object_hook` to `json.loads()`. For example, here is how you would decode JSON data, preserving its order in an `OrderedDict`:

```
>>> s = '{"name": "ACME", "shares": 50, "price": 490.1}'
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> data = json.loads(s, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
>>> data
OrderedDict([('name', 'ACME'), ('shares', 50), ('price', 490.1)])
>>>
```{{execute}}

Here is how you could turn a JSON dictionary into a Python object:

```
>>> class JSONObject(object):
...     def __init__(self, d):
...             self.__dict__ = d
...
>>>
>>> data = json.loads(s, object_hook=JSONObject)
>>> data.name
'ACME'
>>> data.shares
50
>>> data.price
490.1
>>>
```{{execute}}

In this last example, the dictionary created by decoding the JSON data is passed as a single argument to `_init_()`. From there, you are free to use it as you will, such as using it directly as the instance dictionary of the object.

There are a few options that can be useful for encoding JSON. If you would like the output to be nicely formatted, you can use the `indent` argument to `json.dumps()`. This causes the output to be pretty printed in a format similar to that with the `pprint()` function. For example:

```
>>> print(json.dumps(data))
{"price": 542.23, "name": "ACME", "shares": 100}
>>> print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
{
    "price": 542.23,
    "name": "ACME",
    "shares": 100
}
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want the keys to be sorted on output, used the `sort_keys` argument:

```
>>> print(json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True))
{"name": "ACME", "price": 542.23, "shares": 100}
>>>
```{{execute}}

Instances are not normally serializable as JSON. For example:

```
>>> class Point(object):
...     def __init__(self, x, y):
...             self.x = x
...             self.y = y
...
>>> p = Point(2, 3)
>>> json.dumps(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/json/__init__.py", line 226, in dumps
    return _default_encoder.encode(obj)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/json/encoder.py", line 187, in encode
    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/json/encoder.py", line 245, in iterencode
    return _iterencode(o, 0)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/json/encoder.py", line 169, in default
    raise TypeError(repr(o) + " is not JSON serializable")
TypeError: <__main__.Point object at 0x1006f2650> is not JSON serializable
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to serialize instances, you can supply a function that takes an instance as input and returns a dictionary that can be serialized. For example:

```
def serialize_instance(obj):
    d = { '__classname__' : type(obj).__name__ }
    d.update(vars(obj))
    return d
```{{execute}}

If you want to get an instance back, you could write code like this:

```
# Dictionary mapping names to known classes
classes = {
    'Point' : Point
}

def unserialize_object(d):
    clsname = d.pop('__classname__', None)
    if clsname:
        cls = classes[clsname]
        obj = cls.__new__(cls)   # Make instance without calling __init__
        for key, value in d.items():
            setattr(obj, key, value)
            return obj
    else:
        return d
```{{execute}}

Here is an example of how these functions are used:

```
>>> p = Point(2,3)
>>> s = json.dumps(p, default=serialize_instance)
>>> s
'{"__classname__": "Point", "y": 3, "x": 2}'
>>> a = json.loads(s, object_hook=unserialize_object)
>>> a
<__main__.Point object at 0x1017577d0>
>>> a.x
2
>>> a.y
3
>>>
```{{execute}}

The `json` module has a variety of other options for controlling the low-level interpretation of numbers, special values such as `NaN`, and more. Consult the [documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) for further details.
