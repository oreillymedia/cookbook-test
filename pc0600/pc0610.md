## Problem

You need to decode or encode binary data using Base64 encoding.

## Solution

The `base64` module has two functions--`b64encode()` and `b64decode()`â€”that do exactly what you want. For example:

```
>>> # Some byte data
>>> s = b'hello'
>>> import base64

>>> # Encode as Base64
>>> a = base64.b64encode(s)
>>> a
b'aGVsbG8='

>>> # Decode from Base64
>>> base64.b64decode(a)
b'hello'
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Base64 encoding is only meant to be used on byte-oriented data such as byte strings and byte arrays. Moreover, the output of the encoding process is always a byte string. If you are mixing Base64-encoded data with Unicode text, you may have to perform an extra decoding step. For example:

```
>>> a = base64.b64encode(s).decode('ascii')
>>> a
'aGVsbG8='
>>>
```{{execute}}

When decoding Base64, both byte strings and Unicode text strings can be supplied. However, Unicode strings can only contain ASCII characters.
