## Problem

You need to select, insert, or delete rows in a relational database.

## Solution

A standard way to represent rows of data in Python is as a sequence of tuples. For example:

```
stocks = [
    ('GOOG', 100, 490.1),
    ('AAPL', 50, 545.75),
    ('FB', 150, 7.45),
    ('HPQ', 75, 33.2),
]
```{{execute}}

Given data in this form, it is relatively straightforward to interact with a relational database using Python’s standard database API, as described in [PEP 249](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249). The gist of the API is that all operations on the database are carried out by SQL queries. Each row of input or output data is represented by a tuple.

To illustrate, you can use the `sqlite3` module that comes with Python. If you are using a different database (e.g., MySql, Postgres, or ODBC), you’ll have to install a third-party module to support it. However, the underlying programming interface will be virtually the same, if not identical.

The first step is to connect to the database. Typically, you execute a `connect()` function, supplying parameters such as the name of the database, hostname, username, password, and other details as needed. For example:

```
>>> import sqlite3
>>> db = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
>>>
```{{execute}}

To do anything with the data, you next create a cursor. Once you have a cursor, you can start executing SQL queries. For example:

```
>>> c = db.cursor()
>>> c.execute('create table portfolio (symbol text, shares integer, price real)')
<sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x10067a730>
>>> db.commit()
>>>
```{{execute}}

To insert a sequence of rows into the data, use a statement like this:

```
>>> c.executemany('insert into portfolio values (?,?,?)', stocks)
<sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x10067a730>
>>> db.commit()
>>>
```{{execute}}

To perform a query, use a statement such as this:

```
>>> for row in db.execute('select * from portfolio'):
...     print(row)
...
('GOOG', 100, 490.1)
('AAPL', 50, 545.75)
('FB', 150, 7.45)
('HPQ', 75, 33.2)
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to perform queries that accept user-supplied input parameters, make sure you escape the parameters using `?` like this:

```
>>> min_price = 100
>>> for row in db.execute('select * from portfolio where price >= ?',
                         (min_price,)):
...     print(row)
...
('GOOG', 100, 490.1)
('AAPL', 50, 545.75)
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

At a low level, interacting with a database is an extremely straightforward thing to do. You simply form SQL statements and feed them to the underlying module to either update the database or retrieve data. That said, there are still some tricky details you’ll need to sort out on a case-by-case basis.

One complication is the mapping of data from the database into Python types. For entries such as dates, it is most common to use `datetime` instances from the `datetime` module, or possibly system timestamps, as used in the `time` module. For numerical data, especially financial data involving decimals, numbers may be represented as `Decimal` instances from the `decimal` module. Unfortunately, the exact mapping varies by database backend so you’ll have to read the associated documentation.

Another extremely critical complication concerns the formation of SQL statement strings. You should never use Python string formatting operators (e.g., `%`) or the `.format()` method to create such strings. If the values provided to such formatting operators are derived from user input, this opens up your program to an SQL-injection attack (see [http://xkcd.com/327](http://xkcd.com/327)). The special `?` wildcard in queries instructs the database backend to use its own string substitution mechanism, which (hopefully) will do it safely.

Sadly, there is some inconsistency across database backends with respect to the wildcard. Many modules use `?` or `%s`, while others may use a different symbol, such as `:0` or `:1`, to refer to parameters. Again, you’ll have to consult the documentation for the database module you’re using. The `paramstyle` attribute of a database module also contains information about the quoting style.

For simply pulling data in and out of a database table, using the database API is usually simple enough. If you’re doing something more complicated, it may make sense to use a higher-level interface, such as that provided by an object-relational mapper. Libraries such as [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) allow database tables to be described as Python classes and for database operations to be carried out while hiding most of the underlying SQL.
