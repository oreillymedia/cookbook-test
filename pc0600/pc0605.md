## Problem

You want to take the data in a Python dictionary and turn it into XML.

## Solution

Although the `xml.etree.ElementTree` library is commonly used for parsing, it can also be used to create XML documents. For example, consider this function:

```
from xml.etree.ElementTree import Element

def dict_to_xml(tag, d):
    '''
    Turn a simple dict of key/value pairs into XML
    '''
    elem = Element(tag)
    for key, val in d.items():
        child = Element(key)
        child.text = str(val)
        elem.append(child)
    return elem
```{{execute}}

Here is an example:

```
>>> s = { 'name': 'GOOG', 'shares': 100, 'price':490.1 }
>>> e = dict_to_xml('stock', s)
>>> e
<Element 'stock' at 0x1004b64c8>
>>>
```{{execute}}

The result of this conversion is an `Element` instance. For I/O, it is easy to convert this to a byte string using the `tostring()` function in `xml.etree.ElementTree`. For example:

```
>>> from xml.etree.ElementTree import tostring
>>> tostring(e)
b'<stock><price>490.1</price><shares>100</shares><name>GOOG</name></stock>'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to attach attributes to an element, use its `set()` method:

```
>>> e.set('_id','1234')
>>> tostring(e)
b'<stock _id="1234"><price>490.1</price><shares>100</shares><name>GOOG</name>
</stock>'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If the order of the elements matters, consider making an `OrderedDict` instead of a normal dictionary. See [\[ordereddict\]](#ordereddict).

## Discussion

When creating XML, you might be inclined to just make strings instead. For example:

```
def dict_to_xml_str(tag, d):
    '''
    Turn a simple dict of key/value pairs into XML
    '''
    parts = ['<{}>'.format(tag)]
    for key, val in d.items():
        parts.append('<{0}>{1}</{0}>'.format(key,val))
    parts.append('</{}>'.format(tag))
    return ''.join(parts)
```{{execute}}

The problem is that you’re going to make a real mess for yourself if you try to do things manually. For example, what happens if the dictionary values contain special characters like this?

```
>>> d = { 'name' : '<spam>' }

>>> # String creation
>>> dict_to_xml_str('item',d)
'<item><name><spam></name></item>'

>>> # Proper XML creation
>>> e = dict_to_xml('item',d)
>>> tostring(e)
b'<item><name>&lt;spam&gt;</name></item>'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Notice how in the latter example, the characters `<` and `>` got replaced with `<` and `>`.

Just for reference, if you ever need to manually escape or unescape such characters, you can use the `escape()` and `unescape()` functions in `xml.sax.saxutils`. For example:

```
>>> from xml.sax.saxutils import escape, unescape
>>> escape('<spam>')
'&lt;spam&gt;'
>>> unescape(_)
'<spam>'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Aside from creating correct output, the other reason why it’s a good idea to create `Element` instances instead of strings is that they can be more easily combined together to make a larger document. The resulting `Element` instances can also be processed in various ways without ever having to worry about parsing the XML text. Essentially, you can do all of the processing of the data in a more high-level form and then output it as a string at the very end.
