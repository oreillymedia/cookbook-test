## Problem

You would like to extract data from a simple XML document.

## Solution

The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module can be used to extract data from simple XML documents. To illustrate, suppose you want to parse and make a summary of the RSS feed on [Planet Python](http://planet.python.org). Here is a script that will do it:

```
from urllib.request import urlopen
from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse

# Download the RSS feed and parse it
u = urlopen('http://planet.python.org/rss20.xml')
doc = parse(u)

# Extract and output tags of interest
for item in doc.iterfind('channel/item'):
    title = item.findtext('title')
    date = item.findtext('pubDate')
    link = item.findtext('link')

    print(title)
    print(date)
    print(link)
    print()
```{{execute}}

If you run the preceding script, the output looks similar to the following:

Obviously, if you want to do more processing, you need to replace the `print()` statements with something more interesting.

## Discussion

Working with data encoded as XML is commonplace in many applications. Not only is XML widely used as a format for exchanging data on the Internet, it is a common format for storing application data (e.g., word processing, music libraries, etc.). The discussion that follows already assumes the reader is familiar with XML basics.

In many cases, when XML is simply being used to store data, the document structure is compact and straightforward. For example, the RSS feed from the example looks similar to the following:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rss version="2.0" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
    <channel>
      <title>Planet Python</title>
      <link>http://planet.python.org/</link>
      <language>en</language>

The `xml.etree.ElementTree.parse()` function parses the entire XML document into a document object. From there, you use methods such as `find()`, `iterfind()`, and `findtext()` to search for specific XML elements. The arguments to these functions are the names of a specific tag, such as `channel/item` or `title`.

When specifying tags, you need to take the overall document structure into account. Each find operation takes place relative to a starting element. Likewise, the tagname that you supply to each operation is also relative to the start. In the example, the call to `doc.iterfind('channel/item')` looks for all "item" elements under a "channel" element. `doc` represents the top of the document (the top-level "rss" element). The later calls to `item.findtext()` take place relative to the found "item" elements.

Each element represented by the `ElementTree` module has a few essential attributes and methods that are useful when parsing. The `tag` attribute contains the name of the tag, the `text` attribute contains enclosed text, and the `get()` method can be used to extract attributes (if any). For example:

```
>>> doc
<xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree object at 0x101339510>
>>> e = doc.find('channel/title')
>>> e
<Element 'title' at 0x10135b310>
>>> e.tag
'title'
>>> e.text
'Planet Python'
>>> e.get('some_attribute')
>>>
```{{execute}}

It should be noted that `xml.etree.ElementTree` is not the only option for XML parsing. For more advanced applications, you might consider [`lxml`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml). It uses the same programming interface as `ElementTree`, so the example shown in this recipe works in the same manner. You simply need to change the first import to `from lxml.etree import parse`. `lxml` provides the benefit of being fully compliant with XML standards. It is also extremely fast, and provides support for features such as validation, XSLT, and XPath.
