## Problem

You need to decode a string of hexadecimal digits into a byte string or encode a byte string as hex.

## Solution

If you simply need to decode or encode a raw string of hex digits, use the `binascii` module. For example:

```
>>> # Initial byte string
>>> s = b'hello'

>>> # Encode as hex
>>> import binascii
>>> h = binascii.b2a_hex(s)
>>> h
b'68656c6c6f'

>>> # Decode back to bytes
>>> binascii.a2b_hex(h)
b'hello'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Similar functionality can also be found in the `base64` module. For example:

```
>>> import base64
>>> h = base64.b16encode(s)
>>> h
b'68656C6C6F'
>>> base64.b16decode(h)
b'hello'
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For the most part, converting to and from hex is straightforward using the functions shown. The main difference between the two techniques is in case folding. The `base64.b16decode()` and `base64.b16encode()` functions only operate with uppercase hexadecimal letters, whereas the functions in `binascii` work with either case.

Itâ€™s also important to note that the output produced by the encoding functions is always a byte string. To coerce it to Unicode for output, you may need to add an extra decoding step. For example:

```
>>> h = base64.b16encode(s)
>>> print(h)
b'68656C6C6F'
>>> print(h.decode('ascii'))
68656C6C6F
>>>
```{{execute}}

When decoding hex digits, the `b16decode()` and `a2b_hex()` functions accept either bytes or unicode strings. However, those strings must only contain ASCII-encoded hexadecimal digits.
