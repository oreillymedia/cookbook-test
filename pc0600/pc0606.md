## Problem

You want to read an XML document, make changes to it, and then write it back out as XML.

## Solution

The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module makes it easy to perform such tasks. Essentially, you start out by parsing the document in the usual way. For example, suppose you have a document named _pred.xml_ that looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<stop>
    <id>14791</id>
    <nm>Clark &amp; Balmoral</nm>
    <sri>
        <rt>22</rt>
        <d>North Bound</d>
        <dd>North Bound</dd>
    </sri>
    <cr>22</cr>
    <pre>
       <pt>5 MIN</pt>
       <fd>Howard</fd>
       <v>1378</v>
       <rn>22</rn>
   </pre>
   <pre>
       <pt>15 MIN</pt>
       <fd>Howard</fd>
       <v>1867</v>
       <rn>22</rn>
   </pre>
</stop>
```{{execute}}

Here is an example of using `ElementTree` to read it and make changes to the structure:

```
>>> from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse, Element
>>> doc = parse('pred.xml')
>>> root = doc.getroot()
>>> root
<Element 'stop' at 0x100770cb0>

>>> # Remove a few elements
>>> root.remove(root.find('sri'))
>>> root.remove(root.find('cr'))

>>> # Insert a new element after <nm>...</nm>
>>> root.getchildren().index(root.find('nm'))
1
>>> e = Element('spam')
>>> e.text = 'This is a test'
>>> root.insert(2, e)

>>> # Write back to a file
>>> doc.write('newpred.xml', xml_declaration=True)
>>>
```{{execute}}

The result of these operations is a new XML file that looks like this:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='us-ascii'?>
<stop>
    <id>14791</id>
    <nm>Clark &amp; Balmoral</nm>
    <spam>This is a test</spam><pre>
       <pt>5 MIN</pt>
       <fd>Howard</fd>
       <v>1378</v>
       <rn>22</rn>
   </pre>
   <pre>
       <pt>15 MIN</pt>
       <fd>Howard</fd>
       <v>1867</v>
       <rn>22</rn>
   </pre>
</stop>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

Modifying the structure of an XML document is straightforward, but you must remember that all modifications are generally made to the parent element, treating it as if it were a list. For example, if you remove an element, it is removed from its immediate parent using the parent’s `remove()` method. If you insert or append new elements, you also use `insert()` and `append()` methods on the parent. Elements can also be manipulated using indexing and slicing operations, such as `element[i]` or `element[i:j]`.

If you need to make new elements, use the `Element` class, as shown in this recipe’s solution. This is described further in [Turning a Dictionary into XML](#turningadictionaryintoxml).
