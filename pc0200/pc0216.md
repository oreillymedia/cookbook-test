## Problem

You have long strings that you want to reformat so that they fill a user-specified number of columns.

## Solution

Use the `textwrap` module to reformat text for output. For example, suppose you have the following long string:

```
s = "Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes, \
the eyes, not around the eyes, don't look around the eyes, \
look into my eyes, you're under."
```{{execute}}

Here’s how you can use the `textwrap` module to reformat it in various ways:

```
>>> import textwrap
>>> print(textwrap.fill(s, 70))
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes,
not around the eyes, don't look around the eyes, look into my eyes,
you're under.

>>> print(textwrap.fill(s, 40))
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes,
the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, not around
the eyes, don't look around the eyes,
look into my eyes, you're under.

>>> print(textwrap.fill(s, 40, initial_indent='    '))
    Look into my eyes, look into my
eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, not
around the eyes, don't look around the
eyes, look into my eyes, you're under.

>>> print(textwrap.fill(s, 40, subsequent_indent='    '))
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes,
    the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, not
    around the eyes, don't look around
    the eyes, look into my eyes, you're
    under.
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The `textwrap` module is a straightforward way to clean up text for printing—​especially if you want the output to fit nicely on the terminal. On the subject of the terminal size, you can obtain it using `os.get_terminal_size()`. For example:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.get_terminal_size().columns
80
>>>
```{{execute}}

The `fill()` method has a few additional options that control how it handles tabs, sentence endings, and so on. Look at the [documentation for the `textwrap.TextWrapper` class](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.TextWrapper) for further details.
