## Problem

You need to format text with some sort of alignment applied.

## Solution

For basic alignment of strings, the `ljust()`, `rjust()`, and `center()` methods of strings can be used. For example:

```
>>> text = 'Hello World'
>>> text.ljust(20)
'Hello World         '
>>> text.rjust(20)
'         Hello World'
>>> text.center(20)
'    Hello World     '
>>>
```{{execute}}

All of these methods accept an optional fill character as well. For example:

```
>>> text.rjust(20,'=')
'=========Hello World'
>>> text.center(20,'*')
'****Hello World*****'
>>>
```{{execute}}

The `format()` function can also be used to easily align things. All you need to do is use the `<`, `>`, or `^` characters along with a desired width. For example:

```
>>> format(text, '>20')
'         Hello World'
>>> format(text, '<20')
'Hello World         '
>>> format(text, '^20')
'    Hello World     '
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to include a fill character other than a space, specify it before the alignment character:

```
>>> format(text, '=>20s')
'=========Hello World'
>>> format(text, '*^20s')
'****Hello World*****'
>>>
```{{execute}}

These format codes can also be used in the `format()` method when formatting multiple values. For example:

```
>>> '{:>10s} {:>10s}'.format('Hello', 'World')
'     Hello      World'
>>>
```{{execute}}

One benefit of `format()` is that it is not specific to strings. It works with any value, making it more general purpose. For instance, you can use it with numbers:

```
>>> x = 1.2345
>>> format(x, '>10')
'    1.2345'
>>> format(x, '^10.2f')
'   1.23   '
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

In older code, you will also see the `%` operator used to format text. For example:

```
>>> '%-20s' % text
'Hello World         '
>>> '%20s' % text
'         Hello World'
>>>
```{{execute}}

However, in new code, you should probably prefer the use of the `format()` function or method. `format()` is a lot more powerful than what is provided with the `%` operator. Moreover, `format()` is more general purpose than using the `jlust()`, `rjust()`, or `center()` method of strings in that it works with any kind of object.

For a complete list of features available with the `format()` function, consult [the online Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec).
