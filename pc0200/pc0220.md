## Problem

You want to perform common text operations (e.g., stripping, searching, and replacement) on byte strings.

## Solution

Byte strings already support most of the same built-in operations as text strings. For example:

```
>>> data = b'Hello World'
>>> data[0:5]
b'Hello'
>>> data.startswith(b'Hello')
True
>>> data.split()
[b'Hello', b'World']
>>> data.replace(b'Hello', b'Hello Cruel')
b'Hello Cruel World'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Such operations also work with byte arrays. For example:

```
>>> data = bytearray(b'Hello World')
>>> data[0:5]
bytearray(b'Hello')
>>> data.startswith(b'Hello')
True
>>> data.split()
[bytearray(b'Hello'), bytearray(b'World')]
>>> data.replace(b'Hello', b'Hello Cruel')
bytearray(b'Hello Cruel World')
>>>
```{{execute}}

You can apply regular expression pattern matching to byte strings, but the patterns themselves need to be specified as bytes. For example:

```
>>>
>>> data = b'FOO:BAR,SPAM'
>>> import re
>>> re.split('[:,]',data)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/re.py", line 191, in split
    return _compile(pattern, flags).split(string, maxsplit)
TypeError: can't use a string pattern on a bytes-like object

>>> re.split(b'[:,]',data)     # Notice: pattern as bytes
[b'FOO', b'BAR', b'SPAM']
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

For the most part, almost all of the operations available on text strings will work on byte strings. However, there are a few notable differences to be aware of. First, indexing of byte strings produces integers, not individual characters. For example:

```
>>> a = 'Hello World'     # Text string
>>> a[0]
'H'
>>> a[1]
'e'
>>> b = b'Hello World'    # Byte string
>>> b[0]
72
>>> b[1]
101
>>>
```{{execute}}

This difference in semantics can affect programs that try to process byte-oriented data on a character-by-character basis.

Second, byte strings don’t provide a nice string representation and don’t print cleanly unless first decoded into a text string. For example:

```
>>> s = b'Hello World'
>>> print(s)
b'Hello World'               # Observe b'...'
>>> print(s.decode('ascii'))
Hello World
>>>
```{{execute}}

Similarly, there are no string formatting operations available to byte strings.

```
>>> b'%10s %10d %10.2f' % (b'ACME', 100, 490.1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'bytes' and 'tuple'

>>> b'{} {} {}'.format(b'ACME', 100, 490.1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'format'
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you want to do any kind of formatting applied to byte strings, it should be done using normal text strings and encoding. For example:

```
>>> '{:10s} {:10d} {:10.2f}'.format('ACME', 100, 490.1).encode('ascii')
b'ACME              100     490.10'
>>>
```{{execute}}

Finally, you need to be aware that using a byte string can change the semantics of certain operations—​especially those related to the filesystem. For example, if you supply a filename encoded as bytes instead of a text string, it usually disables filename encoding/decoding. For example:

```
>>> # Write a UTF-8 filename
>>> with open('jalape\xf1o.txt', 'w') as f:
...     f.write('spicy')
...

>>> # Get a directory listing
>>> import os
>>> os.listdir('.')          # Text string (names are decoded)
['jalapeño.txt']

>>> os.listdir(b'.')         # Byte string (names left as bytes)
[b'jalapen\xcc\x83o.txt']
>>>
```{{execute}}

Notice in the last part of this example how giving a byte string as the directory name caused the resulting filenames to be returned as undecoded bytes. The filename shown in the directory listing contains raw UTF-8 encoding. See [\[bad\_filenames\]](#bad_filenames) for some related issues concerning filenames.

As a final comment, some programmers might be inclined to use byte strings as an alternative to text strings due to a possible performance improvement. Although it’s true that manipulating bytes tends to be slightly more efficient than text (due to the inherent overhead related to Unicode), doing so usually leads to very messy and nonidiomatic code. You’ll often find that byte strings don’t play well with a lot of other parts of Python, and that you end up having to perform all sorts of manual encoding/decoding operations yourself to get things to work right. Frankly, if you’re working with text, use normal text strings in your program, not byte strings.
