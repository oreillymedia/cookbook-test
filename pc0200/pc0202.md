## Problem

You need to check the start or end of a string for specific text patterns, such as filename extensions, URL schemes, and so on.

## Solution

A simple way to check the beginning or end of a string is to use the `str.startswith()` or `str.endswith()` methods. For example:

```
>>> filename = 'spam.txt'
>>> filename.endswith('.txt')
True
>>> filename.startswith('file:')
False
>>> url = 'http://www.python.org'
>>> url.startswith('http:')
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

If you need to check against multiple choices, simply provide a tuple of possibilities to `startswith()` or `endswith()`:

```
>>> import os
>>> filenames = os.listdir('.')
>>> filenames
[ 'Makefile', 'foo.c', 'bar.py', 'spam.c', 'spam.h' ]
>>> [name for name in filenames if name.endswith(('.c', '.h')) ]
['foo.c', 'spam.c', 'spam.h' ]
>>> any(name.endswith('.py') for name in filenames)
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

Here is another example:

```
from urllib.request import urlopen

def read_data(name):
    if name.startswith(('http:', 'https:', 'ftp:')):
        return urlopen(name).read()
    else:
        with open(name) as f:
             return f.read()
```{{execute}}

Oddly, this is one part of Python where a tuple is actually required as input. If you happen to have the choices specified in a list or set, just make sure you convert them using `tuple()` first. For example:

```
>>> choices = ['http:', 'ftp:']
>>> url = 'http://www.python.org'
>>> url.startswith(choices)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: startswith first arg must be str or a tuple of str, not list
>>> url.startswith(tuple(choices))
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods provide a very convenient way to perform basic prefix and suffix checking. Similar operations can be performed with slices, but are far less elegant. For example:

```
>>> filename = 'spam.txt'
>>> filename[-4:] == '.txt'
True
>>> url = 'http://www.python.org'
>>> url[:5] == 'http:' or url[:6] == 'https:' or url[:4] == 'ftp:'
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

You might also be inclined to use regular expressions as an alternative. For example:

```
>>> import re
>>> url = 'http://www.python.org'
>>> re.match('http:|https:|ftp:', url)
<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x101253098>
>>>
```{{execute}}

This works, but is often overkill for simple matching. Using this recipe is simpler and runs faster.

Last, but not least, the `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods look nice when combined with other operations, such as common data reductions. For example, this statement that checks a directory for the presence of certain kinds of files:

```
if any(name.endswith(('.c', '.h')) for name in os.listdir(dirname)):
   ...
```{{execute}}
