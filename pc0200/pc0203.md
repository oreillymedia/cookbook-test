## Problem

You want to match text using the same wildcard patterns as are commonly used when working in Unix shells (e.g., `**.py**`**, `Dat[0-9]`**`.csv`, etc.).

## Solution

The `fnmatch` module provides two functions--`fnmatch()` and `fnmatchcase()`—that can be used to perform such matching. The usage is simple:

```
>>> from fnmatch import fnmatch, fnmatchcase
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '*.txt')
True
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '?oo.txt')
True
>>> fnmatch('Dat45.csv', 'Dat[0-9]*')
True
>>> names = ['Dat1.csv', 'Dat2.csv', 'config.ini', 'foo.py']
>>> [name for name in names if fnmatch(name, 'Dat*.csv')]
['Dat1.csv', 'Dat2.csv']
>>>
```{{execute}}

Normally, `fnmatch()` matches patterns using the same case-sensitivity rules as the system’s underlying filesystem (which varies based on operating system). For example:

```
>>> # On OS X (Mac)
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
False

>>> # On Windows
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
True
>>>
```{{execute}}

If this distinction matters, use `fnmatchcase()` instead. It matches exactly based on the lower- and uppercase conventions that you supply:

```
>>> fnmatchcase('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
False
>>>
```{{execute}}

An often overlooked feature of these functions is their potential use with data processing of nonfilename strings. For example, suppose you have a list of street addresses like this:

```
addresses = [
    '5412 N CLARK ST',
    '1060 W ADDISON ST',
    '1039 W GRANVILLE AVE',
    '2122 N CLARK ST',
    '4802 N BROADWAY',
]
```{{execute}}

You could write list comprehensions like this:

```
>>> from fnmatch import fnmatchcase
>>> [addr for addr in addresses if fnmatchcase(addr, '* ST')]
['5412 N CLARK ST', '1060 W ADDISON ST', '2122 N CLARK ST']
>>> [addr for addr in addresses if fnmatchcase(addr, '54[0-9][0-9] *CLARK*')]
['5412 N CLARK ST']
>>>
```{{execute}}

## Discussion

The matching performed by `fnmatch` sits somewhere between the functionality of simple string methods and the full power of regular expressions. If you’re just trying to provide a simple mechanism for allowing wildcards in data processing operations, it’s often a reasonable solution.

If you’re actually trying to write code that matches filenames, use the `glob` module instead. See [\[dirlisting\]](#dirlisting).
