A lot of people use Python as a replacement for shell scripts, using it to automate common system tasks, such as manipulating files, configuring systems, and so forth. The main goal of this chapter is to describe features related to common tasks encountered when writing scripts. For example, parsing command-line options, manipulating files on the filesystem, getting useful system configuration data, and so forth. [\[chapter5filesandio\]](#chapter5filesandio) also contains general information related to files and directories.
