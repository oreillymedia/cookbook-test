## Problem

You want to create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Container Service (ACS).

## Solution

To carry out the following steps, you will need to sign up for a (free) [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and install the [Azure CLI (`az`) version 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

First, make sure that you have the correct `az` CLI version installed and then log in:

$ **az --version | grep ^azure-cli**
azure-cli (2.0.13)

$ **az login**
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and
enter the code XXXXXXXXX to authenticate.
\[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "Free Trial",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*",
    "user": {
      "name": "\*\*\*\*\*\*@hotmail.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
\]

As preparation, create an Azure resource group (the equivalent of a project in Google Cloud) called `k8s`. This resource group will hold all your resources, such as VMs and networking components, and makes it easy to clean up and tear down later on:

$ **az group create --name k8s --location northeurope**
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/resourceGroups/k8s",
  "location": "northeurope",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "k8s",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}

Tip

If you’re unsure what [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/) to use for the `--location` argument, execute `az account list-locations` and pick one near you.

Now that you have the resource group `k8s` set up, you can create the cluster with one worker node (_agent_ in Azure terminology), like so:

$ **az acs create --orchestrator-type kubernetes \\
                --resource-group k8s \\
                --name k8scb \\
                --agent-count 1 \\
                --generate-ssh-keys**
waiting for AAD role to propagate.done
{
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
"template": null,
"templateLink": null,
"timestamp": "2017-08-13T19:02:58.149409+00:00"
},
"resourceGroup": "k8s"
}

Note that the `az acs create` command might take up to 10 minutes to complete.

Warning

With the Azure free account you don’t have enough quota to create a default (three-agent) Kubernetes cluster, so you will see something like the following if you try it:

Operation results in exceeding quota limits of Core.
Maximum allowed: 4, Current in use: 0, Additional
requested: 8.

To work around this, either create a smaller cluster (for example, with `--agent-count 1`) or use a paid subscription instead.

As a result, in the Azure portal you should now see something like [Screenshot of the Azure Portal, showing ACS deployments in the k8s resource group](#azure-portal). Start by finding the `k8s` resource group and then navigate your way through the Deployments tab.

You’re now in a position to connect to the cluster:

$ **az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=k8s --name=k8scb**

You can now poke around in the environment and verify the setup:

$ **kubectl cluster-info**
Kubernetes master is running at https://k8scb-k8s-143f1emgmt.northeurope.cloudapp
  .azure.com
Heapster is running at https://k8scb-k8s-143f1emgmt.northeurope.cloudapp.azure
  .com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
KubeDNS is running at https://k8scb-k8s-143f1emgmt.northeurope.cloudapp.azure
  .com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns/proxy
kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://k8scb-k8s-143f1emgmt.northeurope
  .cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard
  /proxy
tiller-deploy is running at https://k8scb-k8s-143f1emgmt.northeurope.cloudapp
  .azure.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/tiller-deploy/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

$ **kubectl get nodes**
NAME                    STATUS                     AGE       VERSION
k8s-agent-1a7972f2-0    Ready                      7m        v1.7.8
k8s-master-1a7972f2-0   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   7m        v1.7.8

And indeed, as you can see from the output that there is one agent (worker) node and one master node.

When you’re done discovering ACS, don’t forget to shut down the cluster and remove all the resources by deleting the resource group `k8s`:

$ **az group delete --name k8s --yes --no-wait**

Although the `az group delete` command returns immediately, it can take up to 10 minutes for all the resources—​such as VMs, virtual networks, or disks—​to be removed and the resource group actually destroyed. You might want to check in the Azure portal to make sure everything went according to plan.

Tip

If you don’t want to or cannot install the Azure CLI, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/) from within your browser instead to carry out the preceding steps to install the Kubernetes cluster.
