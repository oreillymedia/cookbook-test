## Problem

You want to use `kubeadm` to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster from scratch.

## Solution

Download the `kubeadm` CLI tool from the Kubernetes package repository.

You will need `kubeadm` installed on all the servers that will be part of your Kubernetes cluster—​not only the master, but also all the nodes.

For example, if you are using Ubuntu-based hosts, on each host do the following as root to set up the Kubernetes package repository:

\# **apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https**

# **curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -**

# **cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
  deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
  EOF**

# **apt-get update**

Now you can install the Docker engine and the various Kubernetes tools. You will need the following:

*   The `kubelet` binary
    
*   The `kubeadm` CLI
    
*   The `kubectl` client
    
*   `kubernetes-cni`, the Container Networking Interface (CNI) plug-in
    

Install them with:

\# **apt-get install -y docker.io**
# **apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni**

## Discussion

Once all the binaries and tools are installed, you are ready to start bootstrapping your Kubernetes cluster. On your master node, initialize the cluster with:

\# **kubeadm init**
\[kubeadm\] WARNING: kubeadm is in beta, please do not use it for production
clusters.
\[init\] Using Kubernetes version: v1.7.8
\[init\] Using Authorization modes: \[Node RBAC\]
\[preflight\] Running pre-flight checks
...

At the end of the initialization, you will be given a command to execute on all your worker nodes (see [Bootstrapping a Kubernetes Cluster Using kubeadm](#kubeadm_create)). This command uses a token autogenerated by the initialization process.
