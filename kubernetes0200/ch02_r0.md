In this chapter we discuss multiple ways to set up a full-blown Kubernetes cluster. We cover low-level, standardized tooling (`kubeadm`) that also serves as the basis for other installers and show you where to find the relevant binaries for the control plane, as well as for worker nodes. We discuss a containerized Kubernetes setup with `hyperkube`, demonstrate how to write `systemd` unit files to supervise Kubernetes components, and finally show how to set up clusters in Google Cloud and on Azure.
