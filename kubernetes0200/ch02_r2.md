## Problem

You have initialized your Kubernetes master node (see [Installing kubeadm to Create a Kubernetes Cluster](#kubeadm_install)) and now need to add worker nodes to your cluster.

## Solution

With the Kubernetes package repository configured and `kubeadm` installed as shown in [Installing kubeadm to Create a Kubernetes Cluster](#kubeadm_install), run the `join` command using the token given to you when running the `init` step on the master node:

$ **kubeadm join --token _<token>_**

Head back to your master terminal session and you will see your nodes join:

$ **kubectl get nodes**

## Discussion

The final step is to create a network that satisfies the Kubernetes networking requirements—​especially the single IP address per pod. You can use any of the network add-ons.\[[5](#_footnotedef_5 "View footnote.")\] Weave Net,\[[6](#_footnotedef_6 "View footnote.")\] for example, can be installed on Kubernetes clusters v1.6.0 and above with a single `kubectl` command, like so:

$ **export kubever=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\\n')**
$ **kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$kubever"**

This command will create daemon sets (see [\[daemonset\]](#daemonset)) running on all nodes in the cluster. These daemon sets use the host network and a [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) plug-in to configure the local node network. Once the network is in place, your cluster nodes will enter the `READY` state.

For other networking add-ons that you can use to create a pod network during the bootstrapping process with `kubeadm`, see the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/#pod-network).
