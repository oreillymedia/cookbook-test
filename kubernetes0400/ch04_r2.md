## Problem

Rather than creating an object via a generator such as `kubectl run`, you want to explicitly state its properties and then create it.

## Solution

Use `kubectl create` like so:

$ **kubectl create -f _<manifest>_**

In [\[namespace\]](#namespace) you’ll see how to create a namespace using a YAML manifest. This is one of the simplest examples as the manifest is very short. It can be written in YAML or JSON—​for example, with a YAML manifest file _myns.yaml_ like so:

```
apiVersion:    v1
kind:          namespace
metadata:
  name:        myns
```{{execute}}

You can create this object with `kubectl create -f myns.yaml`.

## Discussion

You can point `kubectl create` to a URL instead, or a filename in your local filesystem. For example, to create the frontend for the canonical Guestbook application, get the URL of the raw YAML that defines the application in a single manifest and enter:

$ **kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/ \\
                    master/examples/guestbook/frontend-deployment.yaml**
