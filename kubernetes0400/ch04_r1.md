## Problem

You want to quickly launch a long-running application such as a web server.

## Solution

Use the `kubectl run` command, a generator that creates a deployment manifest on the fly. For example, to create a deployment that runs the Ghost microblogging platform do the following:

$ **kubectl run ghost --image=ghost:0.9**

$ **kubectl get deploy/ghost**
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ghost     1         1         1            0           16s

## Discussion

The `kubectl run` command can take a number of arguments to configure additional parameters of the deployments. For example, you can do the following:

*   Set environment variables with `--env`
    
*   Define container ports with `--port`
    
*   Define a command to run using `--command`
    
*   Automatically create an associated service with `--expose`
    
*   Define the number of pods using `--replicas`
    

Typical usages are as follows. To launch Ghost serving on port 2368 and create a service along with it, enter:

$ **kubectl run ghost --image=ghost:0.9 --port=2368 --expose**

To launch MySQL with the root password set, enter:

$ **kubectl run mysql --image=mysql:5.5 --env=MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD=root**

To launch a `busybox` container and execute the command `sleep 3600` on start, enter:

$ **kubectl run myshell --image=busybox --command -- sh -c "sleep 3600"**

See also `kubectl run --help` for more details about the available arguments.
