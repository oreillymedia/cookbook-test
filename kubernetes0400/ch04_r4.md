## Problem

You want to have full control over how a (long-running) app is launched and supervised.

## Solution

Write a manifest using the Deployment object in it. For the basics, see also [Writing a Pod Manifest from Scratch](#pod_manifest).

Let’s say you have manifest file called _fancyapp.yaml_ with the following content:

```
apiVersion:       extensions/v1beta1
kind:             Deployment
metadata:
  name:           fancyapp
spec:
  replicas:       5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app:      fancy
        env:      development
    spec:
      containers:
      - name:     sise
        image:    mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9876
        env:
        - name:   SIMPLE_SERVICE_VERSION
          value:  "0.9"
```{{execute}}

As you can see, there are a couple of things you might want to do explicitly when launching the app:

*   Set the number of pods (`replicas`), or identical copies, that should be launched and supervised.
    
*   Label it, such as with `env=development` (see also [\[easy\_label\]](#easy_label) and [\[labels\]](#labels)).
    
*   Set environment variables, such as `SIMPLE_SERVICE_VERSION`.
    

Now let’s have a look at what the deployment entails:

$ **kubectl create -f fancyapp.yaml**
deployment "fancyapp" created

$ **kubectl get deploy**
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
fancyapp   5         5         5            0           8s

$ **kubectl get rs**
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
fancyapp-1223770997   5         5         0         13s

$ **kubectl get po**
NAME                        READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
fancyapp-1223770997-18msl   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          15s
fancyapp-1223770997-1zdg4   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          15s
fancyapp-1223770997-6rqn2   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          15s
fancyapp-1223770997-7bnbh   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          15s
fancyapp-1223770997-qxg4v   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          15s

And if we repeat this a few seconds later:

$ **kubectl get po**
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fancyapp-1223770997-18msl   1/1       Running   0          1m
fancyapp-1223770997-1zdg4   1/1       Running   0          1m
fancyapp-1223770997-6rqn2   1/1       Running   0          1m
fancyapp-1223770997-7bnbh   1/1       Running   0          1m
fancyapp-1223770997-qxg4v   1/1       Running   0          1m

Warning

When you want to get rid of a deployment, and with it the replica sets and pods it supervises, execute a command like `kubectl delete deploy/fancyapp`. Do _not_ try to delete individual pods, as they will be recreated by the deployment. This is something that often confuses beginners.

Deployments allow you to scale the app (see [\[scaling-deployments\]](#scaling-deployments)) as well as roll out a new version or roll back to a previous version. They are, in general, good for stateless apps that require pods with identical characteristics.

## Discussion

A deployment is a supervisor for pods and replica sets (RSs), giving you fine-grained control over how and when a new pod version is rolled out or rolled back to a previous state. The RSs and pods that a deployment supervises are generally of no interest to you unless, for example, you need to debug a pod (see [\[debug\_pods\]](#debug_pods)). [Deployment revisions](#deployment-revisions) illustrates how you can move back and forth between deployment revisions.

Note that RS will, going forward, replace the original replication controller (RC), so it’s a good thing to start thinking in terms of RSs rather than RCs. For now, the only difference is that RSs support set-based labels/querying, but we can expect that there will be more features added to the RS and the RC will eventually be deprecated.

Finally, to generate the manifest, you can use the `kubectl create` command and the `--dry-run` option. It will allow you to generate the manifest in YAML or JSON format and save the manifest for later use. For example, to create the manifest of a deployment called `fancy-app` using the Docker image `nginx`, issue the following command:

$ **kubectl create deployment fancyapp --image nginx -o json --dry-run**
{
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "apiVersion": "extensions/v1beta1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "fancy-app",
        "creationTimestamp": null,
        "labels": {
            "app": "fancy-app"
        }
    },
...
