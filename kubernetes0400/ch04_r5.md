## Problem

You have a deployment and want to roll out a new version of your app.

## Solution

Update your deployment and let the default update strategy, `RollingUpdate`, automatically handle the rollout.

For example, suppose you create a new container image and want to update the deployment based on it:

$ **kubectl run sise --image=mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.4.0**
deployment "sise" created

$ **kubectl set image deployment sise mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0**
deployment "sise" image updated

$ **kubectl rollout status deployment sise**
deployment "sise" successfully rolled out

$ **kubectl rollout history deployment sise**
deployments "sise"
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
1               <none>
2               <none>

You’ve now successfully rolled out a new revision of your deployment where only the container image used has changed. All other properties of the deployment, such as the number of replicas, stay unchanged. But what if you want to update other aspects of the deployment, such as changing environment variables? You can use a number of `kubectl` commands to update the deployment. For example, to add a port definition to the current deployment, you can use `kubectl edit`:

$ **kubectl edit deploy sise**

This command will open the current deployment in your default editor, or, when set and exported, in the editor specified by the environment variable `KUBE_EDITOR`.

Say you want to add the following port definition:

```
...
  ports:
  - containerPort: 9876
...
```{{execute}}

The result of the editing process (in this case, with `KUBE_EDITOR` set to `vi`) is shown in [Editing a deployment](#deployment-edit).

Figure 2. Editing a deployment

Once you save and exit the editor, Kubernetes kicks off a new deployment, now with the port defined. Let’s verify that:

$ **kubectl rollout history deployment sise**
deployments "sise"
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
1               <none>
2               <none>
3               <none>

Indeed, we see that revision 3 has been rolled out with the changes we introduced with `kubectl edit`. The reason the `CHANGE-CAUSE` column is empty is that you didn’t use `kubectl create` with the `--record` option. If you want to see what triggered a revision, add this option.

As mentioned earlier, there are more `kubectl` commands that you can use to update your deployment:

*   Use `kubectl apply` to update a deployment (or create it if it doesn’t exist) from a manifest file—​for example, `kubectl apply -f simpleservice.yaml`.
    
*   Use `kubectl replace` to replace a deployment from a manifest file—​for example, `kubectl replace -f simpleservice.yaml`. Note that unlike `apply`, in order to use `replace`, the deployment must already exist.
    
*   Use `kubectl patch` to update a specific key—​for example:
    
    kubectl patch deployment sise -p '{"spec": {"template":
    {"spec": {"containers":
    \[{"name": "sise", "image": "mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0"}\]}}}}'
    

What if you make a mistake or experience issues with the new version of the deployment? Luckily, Kubernetes makes it really easy to roll back to a known good state using the `kubectl rollout undo` command. For example, suppose the last edit was a mistake and you want to roll back to revision 2. You can do this with the following command:

$ **kubectl rollout undo deployment sise ‐‐to‐revision=2**

You can then verify that the port definition has been removed with `kubectl get deploy/sise -o yaml`.

Note

The rollout of a deployment is only triggered if parts of the pod template (that is, keys below `.spec.template`) are changed, such as environment variables, ports, or the container image. Changes to aspects of the deployments, such as the replica count, do not trigger a new deployment.
