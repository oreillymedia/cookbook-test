## Problem

You want to write a pod manifest from scratch and not use a generator such as `kubectl run`.

## Solution

A `Pod` is an `/api/v1` object and, like any other Kubernetes object, its manifest file contains the following fields:

*   apiVersion, which specifies the API version
    
*   kind, which indicates the type of the object
    
*   metadata, which provides some metadata about the object
    
*   spec, which provides the object specification
    

The pod manifest contains an array of containers and an optional array of volumes (see [\[ch\_volumes\_config\]](#ch_volumes_config)). In its simplest form, with a single container and no volume, it looks as follows:

```
apiVersion:    v1
kind:          Pod
metadata:
  name:        oreilly
spec:
  containers:
  - name:      oreilly
    image:     nginx
```{{execute}}

Save this YAML manifest in a file called _oreilly.yaml_ and then use `kubectl` to create it:

$ **kubectl create -f oreilly.yaml**

## Discussion

The API specification of a pod is much richer than what is shown in the Solution, which is the most basic functioning pod. For example, a pod can contain multiple containers, as shown here:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind:       Pod
metadata:
  name:     oreilly
spec:
  containers:
  - name:   oreilly
    image:  nginx
  - name:   safari
    image:  redis
```{{execute}}

A pod can also contain volume definitions to load data in the containers (see [\[data\_exchange\_local\_volume\]](#data_exchange_local_volume)), as well as probes to check the health of the containerized application (see [\[liveness\]](#liveness) and [\[readiness\]](#readiness)).

A description of the thinking behind many of the specification fields and a link to the full API object specification is detailed in the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/).

Note

Unless for very specific reasons, never create a pod on its own. Use a Deployment object (see [Launching a Deployment Using a Manifest](#deployments)) to supervise pods—​it will watch over the pods through another object called a ReplicaSet.
