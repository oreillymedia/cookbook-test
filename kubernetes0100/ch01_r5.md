## Problem

Youâ€™ve started Minikube (see [Installing Minikube to Run a Local Kubernetes Instance](#minikube_install)), and now you want to launch your first application on Kubernetes.

## Solution

As an example, you can start the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) microblogging platform on Minikube using two `kubectl` commands:

$ **kubectl run ghost --image=ghost:0.9**
$ **kubectl expose deployments ghost --port=2368 --type=NodePort**

Monitor the pod manually to see when it starts running and then use the `minikube service` command to open your browser automatically and access Ghost:

$ **kubectl get pods**
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ghost-8449997474-kn86m   1/1       Running   0          2h

$ **minikube service ghost**

## Discussion

The `kubectl run` command is called a _generator_; it is a convenience command to create a `Deployment` object (see [\[deployments\]](#deployments)). The `kubectl expose` command is also a generator, a convenience command to create a `Service` object (see [\[simple\_service\]](#simple_service)) that routes network traffic to the containers started by your deployment.
