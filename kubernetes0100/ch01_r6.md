## Problem

You are using Minikube and want to access the Kubernetes dashboard to start your first application from a graphical user interface.

## Solution

You can open the Kubernetes dashboard from Minikube with:

$ **minikube dashboard**

Click on the plus sign (+) at the top right of the UI that opens in your browser, and you will see the page depicted in [Snapshot of the dashboard application create view](#dashboard_create).

## Discussion

To create an application, click the Create button in the top-right corner, give the application a name, and specify the Docker image that you want to use. Then click the Deploy button and you will be presented with a new view that shows deployments and replica sets, and after a bit of time you will see a pod. These are some key API primitives we will deal with in greater detail in the rest of the book.

The snapshot in [A dashboard overview with a Redis application](#redis-dashboard) presents a typical dashboard view after having created a single application using the Redis container.

If you go back to a terminal session and use the command-line client, you will see the same thing:

$ **kubectl get pods,rs,deployments**
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/redis-3215927958-4x88v   1/1       Running   0          24m

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/redis-3215927958   1         1         1         24m

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/redis   1         1         1            1           24m

Your Redis pod will be running the Redis server, as the following logs show:

$ **kubectl logs redis-3215927958-4x88v**
