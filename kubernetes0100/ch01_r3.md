## Problem

You want to use Kubernetes for testing or development or for training purposes on your local machine.

## Solution

Use Minikube. Minikube is a tool that lets you use Kubernetes on your local machine without any installation except for the `minikube` binary. It takes advantage of your local hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox, KVM) and launches a virtual machine that runs Kubernetes in a single node.

To install the Minikube CLI locally, you can get the latest release or build from source. To get the v0.18.0 release and install `minikube` on a Linux-based machine, do:

$ **curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.18.0/ \\
                    minikube-linux-amd64**

$ **chmod +x minikube**

$ **sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/**

This will put the `minikube` binary in your path and make it accessible from everywhere.

## Discussion

Once `minikube` is installed, you can verify the version that is running with the following command:

$ **minikube version**
minikube version: v0.18.0

You can start it with:

$ **minikube start**

Once the startup phase has finished, your Kubernetes client, `kubectl`, will have a `minikube` context and will automatically start using this context. Checking what nodes you have in your cluster will return the `minikube` hostname:

$ **kubectl get nodes**
NAME       STATUS    AGE
minikube   Ready     5d
