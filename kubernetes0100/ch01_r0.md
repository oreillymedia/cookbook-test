In this first chapter we present recipes that will help you get started with Kubernetes. We show you how to use Kubernetes without installing it and introduce components such as the command-line interface (CLI) and the dashboard, which allow you to interact with a cluster, as well as Minikube, an all-in-one solution you can run on your laptop.
