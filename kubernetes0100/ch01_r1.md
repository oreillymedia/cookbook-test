## Problem

You want to try Kubernetes without installing it.

## Solution

To use Kubernetes without installing it, follow the [interactive tutorial on the Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).

You can also use the [Kubernetes playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground) on Katacoda. Once you’re signed in with GitHub or one of the social media authentication methods, you will see the page depicted in [Screenshot of the Katacoda Kubernetes playground](#katacoda_k8s_playground).

Note that an environment you launch in the playground is only available for a limited time—​currently one hour—​but it’s free of charge and all you need is a browser.
