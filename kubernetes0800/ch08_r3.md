Which volume type you choose depends entirely on your use case. For example, for a temporary scratch space, an `emptyDir` would be fine, but when you need to make sure your data survives node failures you’ll want to look into networked volumes, or cloud-provider–specific ones if you run Kubernetes in a public cloud setting.
