## Problem

Rather than manually provisioning persistent volumes with persistent volume claims like in [Using a Persistent Volume with Minikube](#pv_minikube), you want to automate the processâ€”that is, dynamically provision PVs based on storage or pricing requirements.

## Solution

For GKE, follow the steps outlined in the blog post by Saad Ali ["Dynamic Provisioning and Storage Classes in Kubernetes"](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/10/dynamic-provisioning-and-storage-in-kubernetes.html).

## Discussion

In general, the workflow to provision and claim PVs is as shown in [Workflow for provisioning and claiming persistent volumes](#persistent-volumes-and-claims-flow).

The workflow involves admins and developers coordinating available types and sizes of volumes. With dynamic provisioning, this workflow can be streamlined.
