## Problem

As an admin, you want to provide your developers with an API access key in a secure way; that is, without sharing it in clear text in your Kubernetes manifests.

## Solution

Use a local volume of type [`secret`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#secret).

Let’s say you want to give your developers access to an external service that is accessible via the passphrase `open sesame`.

First, create a text file called _passphrase_ that holds the passphrase:

$ **echo -n "open sesame" > ./passphrase**

Next, create the [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), using the _passphrase_ file:

$ **kubectl create secret generic pp --from-file=./passphrase**
secret "pp" created

$ **kubectl describe secrets/pp**
Name:           pp
Namespace:      default
Labels:         <none>
Annotations:    <none>

Type:   Opaque

Data
====
passphrase:     11 bytes

From an admin point of view, you’re all set now and it’s time for your developers to consume the secret. So let’s switch hats and assume you’re a developer and want to use the passphrase from within a pod.

You would consume the secret, for example, by mounting it as a volume into your pod and then reading it out as a normal file. Create the pod and mount the volume now:

```
apiVersion:        v1
kind:              Pod
metadata:
  name:            ppconsumer
spec:
  containers:
  - name:          shell
    image:         busybox
    command:
      - "sh"
      - "-c"
      - "mount | grep access  && sleep 3600"
    volumeMounts:
      - name:      passphrase
        mountPath: "/tmp/access"
        readOnly:  true
  volumes:
  - name:          passphrase
    secret:
      secretName:  pp
```{{execute}}

Now launch the pod and have a look at its logs, where you would expect to see the pp secret file mounted as _/tmp/access/passphrase_:

$ **kubectl create -f ppconsumer.yaml**
pod "ppconsumer" created

$ **kubectl logs ppconsumer**
tmpfs on /tmp/access type tmpfs (ro,relatime)

To access the passphrase from within the running container, simply read out the _passphrase_ file in _/tmp/access_, like so:

$ **kubectl exec ppconsumer -i -t -- sh**

/ # cat /tmp/access/passphrase
open sesame

## Discussion

Secrets exist in the context of a namespace, so you need to take that into account when setting them up and/or consuming them.

You can access a secret from a container running in a pod via one of the following:

*   A volume (as shown in the Solution, where the content is stored in a `tmpfs` volume)
    
*   An [environment variable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables)
    

Also, note that the size of a secret is limited to 1 MB.

In addition to user-defined secrets, Kubernetes automatically creates secrets for service accounts to access the API. For example, with Prometheus installed (see [\[prom\_minikube\]](#prom_minikube)), you’d see something like [Screenshot of the Prometheus service account secret](#prom-sa-secret) in the Kubernetes dashboard.

Tip

`kubectl create secret` deals with three types of secrets and, depending on your use case, you might want to choose different ones:

*   The `docker-registry` type is for use with a Docker registry.
    
*   The `generic` type is what we used in the Solution; it creates a secret from a local file, directory, or literal value (you need to base64-encode it yourself).
    
*   With `tls` you can create, for example, a secure SSL certificate for ingress.
    

`kubectl describe` doesn’t show the content of the secret in the plain text. This avoids "over-the-shoulder" password grabs. You can, however, easily decode it manually since it’s not encrypted—​only base64-encoded:

$ **kubectl get secret pp -o yaml | \\
  grep passphrase | \\
  cut -d":" -f 2 | \\
  awk '{$1=$1};1' | \\
  base64 --decode**
open sesame

In this command, the first line retrieves a YAML representation of the secret, and the second line with the `grep` pulls out the line `passphrase: b3BlbiBzZXNhbWU=` (note the leading whitespace here). Then, the `cut` extracts the content of the passphrase, and the `awk` command gets rid of the leading whitespace. Finally, the `base64` command turns it into the original data again.

Tip

Prior to Kubernetes 1.7, the API server stored secrets as plain text in `etcd`. Now you have the option to encrypt them using the `--experimental-encryption-provider-config` option when launching the `kube-apiserver`.
