## Problem

You have two or more containers running in a pod and want to be able to exchange data via filesystem operations.

## Solution

Use a local volume of type `emptyDir`.

The starting point is the following pod manifest, _exchangedata.yaml_, which has two containers (`c1` and `c2`) that each mount the local volume `xchange` into their filesystem, using different mount points:

```
apiVersion:          v1
kind:                Pod
metadata:
  name:              sharevol
spec:
  containers:
  - name:            c1
    image:           centos:7
    command:
      - "bin/bash"
      - "-c"
      - "sleep 10000"
    volumeMounts:
      - name:        xchange
        mountPath:   "/tmp/xchange"
  - name:            c2
    image:           centos:7
    command:
      - "bin/bash"
      - "-c"
      - "sleep 10000"
    volumeMounts:
      - name:        xchange
        mountPath:   "/tmp/data"
  volumes:
  - name:            xchange
    emptyDir:        {}
```{{execute}}

Now you can launch the pod, `exec` into it, create data from one container, and read it out from the other one:

$ **kubectl create -f exchangedata.yaml**
pod "sharevol" created

$ **kubectl exec sharevol -c c1 -i -t -- bash**
\[root@sharevol /\]# mount | grep xchange
/dev/vda1 on /tmp/xchange type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
\[root@sharevol /\]# echo 'some data' > /tmp/xchange/data
\[root@sharevol /\]# exit

$ **kubectl exec sharevol -c c2 -i -t -- bash**
\[root@sharevol /\]# mount | grep /tmp/data
/dev/vda1 on /tmp/data type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
\[root@sharevol /\]# cat /tmp/data/data
some data

## Discussion

A local volume is backed by the node the pod and its containers are running on. If the node goes down or you have to carry out maintenance on the node (see [\[drain\_nodes\]](#drain_nodes)), then the local volume is gone and all the data is lost.

There are some use cases where local volumes are fine—​for example, for some scratch space or when the canonical state is obtained from somewhere else, such as an S3 bucket—​but in general you’ll want to use a volume backed by networked storage (see [Dynamically Provisioning Persistent Storage on GKE](#pvc_gke)).
